       " 'Reviews': ['\\nDO NOT BUY FIRE TV DEVICES!!! CHOOSE ANOTHER STREAMING PLAYER BRAND!!!Worst customer service experience in my life from Amazon!!!! Amazon sent me a completely broken Fire TV 4k stick! From day one the audio cuts out entirely after a few mins of playing a video, and does not return until stick is physically unplugged from power. Then it cuts out again. Problem occurs in all video apps, and I tried full software restore, plugging into multiple different TVs, as well as different audio connections (direct to TV through HDMI, Through receiver, through bluetooth on multiple devices.) And my other Fire TV 4k of the same model works fine in this same TV, so... THE STICK IS BROKEN! So I contact Amazon through their chat interface and Parmish is a total disaster at helping me. I tell him that I have done a full software restore on it, at which point he responds that I need to do a full software restore. Ya know, the thing I just told him that I did already. Then I tell him I have already tried plugging the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver, and he says \"well than what I need you to do is plug the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver.\" This happened over and over. It was like a bad joke. But I wasn\\'t laughing. Finally after about an hour of this nonsense he decides that my Fire TV stick needs to be replaced. Then he says I \"Have no card on file\", what ever that means. So after about 10 more unanswered and ignored questions to him about just what he\\'s talking about I finally figure out he means my Amazon account has no credit card on file. But it does have a card on file. I log in and verify this. The card is up to date and working, and amazon had just charged it that day even. So I tell him this, and he responds that I need a credit card on file in order to send out a replacement, even though it won\\'t be charged. I tell him again that the card is on file and working, and he says it need to be updated. Even though it does not. So I hit \"edit\" on my card info on file, and resubmit the same working card. Parmish sees this on his end and says thank you. Then he says I need to update my OTHER CARD on file. I look and there is an old credit card from 6 years ago on the account from a bank I no longer use, and its not even selected as the active/favored card, so It doesn\\'t even matter that it there, but I delete it anyways just to be sure. Then Parmish says I need to reenter and update that old card (that I no longer bank with) in order to get a replacement sent out. At this point I\\'m done with Parmish. The whole conversation was absolutely ridiculous! I say \"thank you for the help but I need a supervisor. Please transfer me to a supervisor.\"So Parmish transfers me to Vikas. I ask Vikas if he is a supervisor and he says \"no.\" (Are you surprised by this? I wasn\\'t.) So I explain that I was suppose to be transferred to a supervisor and ask that Vikas transfer me directly to a supervisor. And I\\'m transferred to Annal.I ask Annal if they are a supervisor, and they answer... get ready for it... are you ready... they answer ...\"No\" !!!!!!!!! They &^^&%&$^^%^ answer \"No.\"So I close the chat window I just wasted over an hour on and I call Amazon. This is where the real nightmare begins. I start off with a regular customer service rep and I ask her to transfer me to a supervisor right away because this will be my 4th attempt to get a supervisor. She is very polite and gets me a supervisor on the line write away. I explain the entire issue with the Fire Tv 4k Stick and everything I have done to troubleshoot it already YET AGIAN, and the supervisor apologizes for all the insane trouble I\\'ve been having. She sounds like she really wants to help me, asked some more questions, and then tells me that she can\\'t replace this particular model because its out of stock. I had just checked the stock, so I knew it wasn\\'t out. I checked it again, and then told her it appears to have plenty of stock. She verified what model it was again, then said \"oh yes, I guess we do have it, let my put you on hold while I try to send you one.\" She comes back a while later and says \"the system won\\'t let me send you one. I have to transfer you to a Fire TV Specialist, buy I\\'ll get you a manager there as well.So then I have to go through the whole thing again with this new Fire TV Specialist person. She keeps putting me on hold to check things over and over again. And she has me do crazy things - For example, she insists I go to my TV, unplug the other working Fire TV I now have in there, and plug this broken one back in, then load it up and read the serial number off of it to her from the info screen. Why? Doesn\\'t she already have that info? She should. And WHY AM I PLUGGING A $25 DEFECTIVE BROKEN DEVICE BACK INTO MY $2,000 FLATSCREEN??!!! I don\\'t want to do that. I shouldn\\'t be asked to do that. What the hell? Then she keeps checking to see if I\\'m still in warranty. REALL???!!! I JUST got this stick in the mail. I JUST GOT IT. How long is the warranty period that she has to keep checking on.. 5 hours after purchase. Also, this is a brand new model that just came out. HOW COULD ANY OF THEM POSSIBLY BE OUT OF WARRANTY??!!Finally after 3 HOURS of talking to people about this and a final, particularly long hold while the Fire TV Specialist person tries to figure out if I can be sent a replacement - I give up. I tell her I\\'ll just return it instead - just so I can just get off the phone. But I\\'m NOT returning it - That too would probably turn into another huge nightmare. It\\'s not worth my $25 for all this aggravation. So... I\\'M DONE. This is ridiculous! After speaking with a total of SIX people for over THREE HOURS.. My brand new Fire TV 4K stick in now in my trash can and I\\'m never buying a Fire TV product again. All Amazon need to do was have me send in my broken one and then send out a replacement. That\\'s It. They could have sorted out all their serial numbers and insane data requirements after they got my stick back. AS a customer, I simply got something in the mail that arrived broken and I wanted it replaced soon after I got it. How simple of a transition is that? But instead I got this torrent of poor customer service and bizarre data mining. SO.. Officially.. I\\'m no longer a Fire TV user.I\\'m currently switching my entire smart TV ecosystem for the entire house over to Google\\'s Android TV now, I\\'ve had it with Fire TV, and I suggest you do the same. Android TV systems don\\'t suffer from the same app limitations that Amazon does (IE with Fire TV you get access got about 12% of the Android apps available to the rest of the Android TV world, Even though Fire TV runs on Android, and you can install what ever apps you want on your Android TV device without having to TRICK IT into installing it), it still works and runs apps (like playing a game or looking at photos) even if your internet connection goes down (Fire TV becomes a useless brick without constant internet), and the whole thing just seems to run better. I don\\'t have time to deal with Amazon\\'s nightmare anymore. All I needed was for Amazon to replace the broken Fire TV stick they JUST sent me, and they can\\'t even do that. So, ummmm... BYEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWe purchased a 4K Ultra HD Fire Stick as a replacement for a Fire Box that we had for the last 4 years.  The old Fire Box worked well and was reliable except for a needed occasional reboot every month or so.  This new Fire Stick is anything but reliable.When the Fire Stick works, we do not have any complaints.  However, what constitutes this one-star review is the Fire Stick’s propensity to stop streaming (as indicated by the rolling circle on the screen) due to loss of internet connection.  Most days this occurs multiple times. (As an aside Wifi connection is not lost at this time.)  Last night was the worst, four loss of connections during a two hour movie.This loss of connection is specific to the Fire Stick.  When the Fire Stick has a connection loss with the internet, our tablets, desktop, as well as Alexa unit (no less than a foot from the Fire Stick) all stay connected to the internet and work properly, so not an ISP issue.  I have switched the Fire Stick to various HDMI ports on the TV and use the HDMI extender cable and the loss of connection issue continues to occur.  This a Fire Stick specific issue.We contacted Customer Service and working with them was taxing.  The first call was disconnected in the middle of the call without an resolution.  Upon calling back and restating the issues, the second rep said the issue was due to the ISP (which couldn’t be the case since our other devices were connected and working properly when the Fire Stick lost connection) and/or reboot the stick each time the problem happened (rebooting the Fire Stick multiple times in one night is an unacceptable suggestion).  I’ve asked for a replacement, but if the same issues occur, it’ll be time to investigate another streaming device.I do not know if this issue is caused by the need to place the stick behind the TV and/or a software or hardware issue, but we are very disappointed in lack of reliable quality of the new Fire Stick.  Hopefully the placement stick will work.An update:  Customer Service told me to have faith that downloading the latest updates would solve my problem.  Updates were downloaded and the problem was not fixed.  The Fire Stick still has connectivity issues. The Fire Stick has some defect.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI bought this to limit the time my kids spend on the tv. We bought them fire tablets 2 summers ago and it came with the year of “freetime” (what kids+ used to be called) and I kinda liked it kinda didn’t, that would be a review for the tablet though. Anyway, we decided not to keep it when the year was up and their tablets currently just have games/movies that I’ve bought and added manually. None of the kids+ stuff shows up. Obviously, right, since I don’t pay for it. However, on the tv, it clogs up the whole tv with locked kids+ content. My kids have to scroll through like 8 rows of locked categories before getting to the “added for you” row. What the heck! I contacted customer service and they said to deregister it and then register it again. That worked for a few minutes but the next time I went back to the kids profile it was all back again. I’ve only had the thing for like a week but if I can’t get this stuff to go away I think I’ll have to return it and seek a refund for the games I just bought since they can’t even find them lost in all the locked content.The stick itself stream quality is just fine, we have a Roku tv though and it’s probably the same so we don’t need it. Just bought for the kids features. Alexa so far hasn’t done anything I’ve asked, doesn’t really understand things as well as Siri, and doesn’t work in kids profile (might be a setting to change that though) so eh as far as she goes.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI bought a fire stick 4k and a 4k max to replace 2 chromecasts with the intention of being able to tell Alexa to power on and off one of the existing TV instead of having a routine for Alexa to tell google assistant to turn off the TV.I already have a Toshiba Fire TV with Alexa built in working perfectly (before these showed up).  If I link a second fire device (4k/4kmax), I am only be able to pause playback using the linked echo device on any of the fire devices. If I use the Alexa button on the remote I have full Alexa functionality, but none of my echo devices will function correctly after adding either fire stick to the app. I tried researching fixes and tried everything I could think of to make it work before calling tech support.Tech support told me to try a couple fixes that I had already tried before calling with no success. I was transferred 3 times  and finally they just told me to return them. After sending the return information via email, I left with a connected call and no responses or music from the support side. I waited a few minutes for a response before giving up and hanging up. Tech support seems to have limited knowledge concerning the devices they support. I used the online support tool before calling, and calling just resulted in them basically reading the online support site to me.I was going to purchase another TV with the Fire TV built in, but now I doubt I will because I dont want to have to return it because it breaks the system.The amount of money involved is nothing to them, but I will probably never buy or reccomend another Alexa product based on this experience.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI ordered three fire sticks and two of them are fine but the third does not have the same functions as the first two that allow me to download unknown apps. I need this function on all three and AMAZON CS told me that there was nothing she could do for me fix it. She did let me know that she would send my complaint over and i could expect to hear from Amazon in 2 or 3 days!!! Meanwhile she can't hear half of what I'm asking because her dog is barking in the background. She also could not help me at all navigate the settings she tried to walk me though. So, know i have a streaming service i can only use on two of the three tv sets. I guess Amazon thinks I will just need to purchase another service as well if I want to use their equipment??????? This is something that could have been resolved in two min, but I was on the phone for an hour and got the run around. I asked to talk to someone else and was told I would need to hang up and reach out to another number!!! I guess another hour of my time is no big deal to them.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI purchased two Fire Sticks, one works perfectly.  The second one will not allow me to log onto the Apple TV app.  I have spoken with two Amazon Reps in Customer service and one told me it wasApples Fault, the second one said that someone would get back with me.  I also been on chatt with another and they said that to call Apple.  I told them that I did and Apple's Engineers got back with me after checking it out and said that it was Amazon's fault.  I offered to exhange the Fire Stick with the Rep.  He told me that He will work on it and would get back with me.  After three days NOTHING.  You customer Service is terrible.  When APPLE said that would get back with me at 12:00 noon eastern time today, they did just that.  I am going to wait till the exchange date expires for you to do something.

We have tried to sync them manually following instructions given by the support team and what we found online. It isn't perfect, but it is better. After a little while, it is VERY noticeable again. It is not limited to one application, either. We have seen it happen on Prime Video and YouTube TV. I have not had these issues using our Smart TVs. Since it works fine on Smart TVs, and since it is not just one application, the FireStick TV Stick 4k is the last remaining culprit.When we used Hulu+, it would just kick us out or lag forever. Did not have as many issues with that when I used either a Smart TV or my PS4. Just a horrible product. I am going to try to get Rokus for my other TVs and see if that helps at all.I did not use Alexa or voice commands very often, so I do not have a large sample size, but it seems to work fairly well for those types of functions.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nFireTV stick 4K was delivered defective and never worked, no registration information or applications were ever downloaded, a 3 second fire tv logo is the only thing it would do... I tried searching online for a possible quick fix but the only option left was calling Amazons tech support and after an hour on the phone, nothing worked...unplug, wait10 minutes, plug back up, restart....change out adapter...change batteries...factory reset...etc... After being put on hold for another long period as he spoke to his supervisor, his response was that I needed to purchase another Firestick 4K with a 15% ...I thought this situation would have been made right by offering to send me a replacement Firestick 4K and a return postage box for the defective product...that way Amazons Quality Control could inspect and verify that  it wouldn\\'t boot up beyond the initial firetv logo...I guess it\\'s just more convenient for them to resort to \"plausible deniability\" on their end and ignore my petty grievances as just someone trying to scam them for free merchandise or that through my own my error that made it defective. I\\'ve had 6 Firesticks over the past few years, mostly because of the generation upgrades and never have I  experienced an issue like this... I\\'ve spent a great deal of time researching online for a solution...a great deal of time waiting on hold to speak to an Amazon representative...where I have to speak slow and simple English because it\\'s to a foreign call center....constantly having to ask the technician to repeat because of accent or the limited basic vocabulary, especially having to translate technical terms all while  being put on hold for lengthy periods of time made it extremely challenging...if not for optimistic hopes of possibly solving this problem soon then my patience would have gotten the best of me...Amazon failed in it\\'s responsibility of ensuring quality service and product.  I can assure you, my time invested in trying to make this right would equal 4 times the value in price I paid expecting a fully functioning Firestick 4K...and what aggravates me the most is that Amazon shows no effort in providing good customer service or responsibility in the quality of their products....Is it my integrity being questioned by some gaslighting Amazon employee over a 35 dollar transaction they failed to honor? dayKeep th\\' change, my integrity ain\\'t for sale.Good day to you\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI have a fire stick lite that I use a lot but I wanted something with a little more punch and I saw the 4k stick was on sale for half off so I jumped on it and bought it. Then I received it and the box looked like it was opened and or damaged. I connected the stick to my tv to start the set up process and that’s when I noticed how slow it was going. It felt like there was a delay in the input. So I changed the batteries hoping that was the fix but it wasn’t. When I went to make sure it has the latest update I had to literally update it 6 times. Then I noticed that a few features were missing and so I went back to see if I had another update and sure enough I ended up updating 2 more times but the features were still missing. So I downloaded my first app and it took about 5 min to download and that’s when I got fed up and just threw it in the trash.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI purchased this 4K Fire TV device along with an Ethernet adapter, since I have a network switch under my TV that has a direct connection to my router. This way I don't have the rely on wifi for HD reception. I hooked every up and it all seemed to be working fine on one of my spare HDMI ports on my Sony TV. As the days went by I started noticing that watching various movies from my Home screen, on Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, that I would get audio drop outs on my Sonos Beam Soundbar. When this would happen, I would back up the movie to see if the problem was with the movie, but it never was. It was getting so bad, that I also lost my surround speakers and they would come and go intermitently. I contacted Sonos, who has a very good support staff. After a couple of calls and sending them diagnostic codes, they told me that there was noise on the HDMI Bus and asked what other devices were plugged in. The only two devices were my Sony Blu-Ray player and the newly introduced Fire TV. Since I have the Blu-Ray player plugged in for over two years, I removed the Fire TV.  Right away, I notice a difference.  My surrounds came back and worked well, and as the evenings went by, I noticed that I stopped getting the audio drop outs. Actually, the Fire TV is only a platform to load and install apps that you have to pay for anyway. It's like my old Roku box which I removed a while back when Sony told me that I would need a CEC-less adapter for Roku.  So, now it's less than one month and I don't know what to do. I placed everything back in their original boxes and may give Amazon a call tomorrow. Otherwise, I may just hold on to the two devices and see if anyone else wants them.\\n\",\n",

Previews will be full screen but once you hit play, not full screen anymore.  Don't have this problem with a Roku which is what I was replacing to get an upgrade I thought.  Can't log into AMC+ with your existing account, it will make you setup a new account and pay double the money.  I already paid for a year and will use my existing one.  Amazon seems to be acting like Apple and want to control the apps and where you spend the money.  My next move is to return this and get the latest Roku 4k stick.

If you want a decent array of recent movies, you\\'ll have to purchase subscription for a dozen different links (whatever ghey\\'re called) which will cost you a couple of hundred bucks a month.Keep your cable for $150.00/month (or $175./$200.) and watch basically whatever  you want all in one place.Firestick SUCKS!\\n',\n",

Them: of well you need to upgrade to 4K Max. Spoke to supervisor same crap. Was advised not to trade in through their trade in program because I would only receive $4.00. WTH....oh but we will give you 15% off towards a new purchase. Ok I fell for it. Received the device yesterday plugged in started the install process. Once I was connected to the Wi-Fi I it started a software update. Then I received an error message stating the update failed to unplugged for a fews seconds and try again. Well this went on after 5 tries disconnecting everything piece by piece. Same thing. Called have to get a replacement. Moral to the story is why are you you no longer supporting a device you created barely 2 years ago just to force an upgrade on junk you threw together just to make a quick buck. Save your money everything is a hustle now. I'll press my luck with a Roku device. Apple and Amazon play to much. Wish me luck!\\n\",\n",

Once the video starts to play the screen goes dark and their is no image just sound. At first I thought it was just one of the platforms but now I can say with out a doubt it does it on every single platform especially after I watch an episode then turn of the fire stick so when I come back to watch episode 2 later on I have to restart the entire fire stick so that I can watch episode 2 and if I do the same thing for episode 3 guess what got to restart the whole thing again.

Then I don't want to see things like LGBT channels in the open, you are close to running an adult service. Posting warnings will not stop teenagers from looking around. You need to have an option to remove the entire LGBT listings from the front screen.  we have considered canceling the entire Amazon Fire Stick. I know elderly people that have been forced on this because they are doing away with cable box access and they are totally lost, several have been forced to buy new TV's etc. Cable was best it just was the FCC and congress that failed to limit all the ads, the shopping channels were every where.

They took my contact information and said they'd get back to me. THEY HAVEN'T!My recommendation is to steer clear of a Firestick since both of ours failed only months after getting them. The first was easily replaced when I chatted with an Amazon rep; the second is still not working and the people I talked with (two of them) about it just gave me excuses, lies and that Firestick is still not working.Again, think about your purchasing this item and if you get a warranty, it's just a waste of money.\\n\",\n",

First off the clutter visually stresses me out, things lag too much cuz of all that's running on the screen, they handcuff you too much so that even though you finally get things running smooth, you can't access basic things. I basically had to use it without any home screen at all and without any launcher just to immediately remove the lag and clutter, cuz 3rd party launchers have too many issues as well I don't like. Firestick basically taught me how to be more tech savy cuz even though all that has drove me crazy, it's still a good streaming device if that kind of stuff never bothers you. But I don't like an inconsistent device that laggs so much and ruins my experience to the point where I gotta restart, scroll through adverts, use only one row, try to ignore 99% of the entire screen, just to get back to what I was trying to watch in the first place. Google just has everything available with easy AND and apps only mode too. Ok rant is over.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nI bought the first generation of Fire TV years ago, and loved it. I bought the second generation when it came out and immediately had reliability issues, including frequent random crashes. After that I switched to Roku and found it far more reliable, and with less annoying advertising on the screen to deal with.But recently I wanted to try the feature where a Fire TV can use an echo speaker/subwoofer pair as a home theatre, for use in my living room. So I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K to try it. This was my experience:- The main screen is extremely busy, with giant advertisements for sporting events I have zero interest in taking up the entire screen. I have to scroll down several times to get to the streaming apps I use. 1/5 for main screen design and user experience.- Once set up the video streaming was good, and high quality. 5/5 for streaming quality.- When setting up the echo home theatre it did not register my speaker/subwoofer pair as an available option. It was listen but greyed out. I tried multiple times that day and it was always greyed out, with no explanation why. I tried again the next day and it was magically available, so I connected it. 1/5 for making the process so unreliable.- Once connected the audio quality was very good, and I put on something to watch. 5/5 for audio quality once connected.- Roughly once every hour the audio would be replaced by either silence or static for about 5 seconds before reconnecting. So this home theatre option appears to be very unreliable. 1/5 for home theatre reliability.- The remote/Fire TV frequently has an odd lag, where I'll push a button and it'll take about 1 second before the screen responds. I don't know if this is an issue with the remote or the Fire TV. It make for an annoying experience. Additionally, when I press the power button to turn the tv off, about half the time it'll turn back on a second later - as if it sent 2 power button presses to the Fire TV. BTW I'm only sitting about 12 feet from the TV with no obstructions at all. 1/5 for remote reliability and user experience.After 2 days of annoyance and frustration I'm switching back to the Roku, which works reliably, and giving up on Fire TVs permanently. The first gen was great, the ones since then have been unreliable. In fact in my experience most Amazon devices have been very unreliable - Fire TVs, Fire tablets, Echos. I think I'm done with Amazon's poorly made devices.Overall 2/5 stars total for the great streaming quality, but everything else is awful and makes it almost unusable.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nPurchased certified/refurbished on 6/4/2022 for $27.50 and installed/set up the Fire TV Stick 4K device a couple of weeks later.  Device was listed as \"Condition: Used - Acceptable - Small cosmetic imperfection on the item associated with regular use\" so I figured, no big deal.  A small cosmetic imperfection was worth the $22.49 in savings (normal $49.99 + tax) especially since there was no visible imperfection when I received it.  Then without warning, the device stopped working 9/3/2022.  Called Amazon support on 9/5/2022 and after 30 minutes of troubleshooting, it was determined the device did not in fact work and needed to be returned.  The Amazon rep was helpful, but could only process the return for a partial refund of $22 because I apparently purchased  from Amazon Warehouse instead of Amazon.com even though my order details show the seller as Amazon.com Services LLC and the $5.50 would be held back as a restocking fee.  Considering I had to return the Fire TV Stick 4K because of a defect and purchase a new replacement at a higher cost, I felt this was unfair and voiced my disappointment.  The rep was sympathetic to my concern and indicated she put a note on my account and said I could call back after my return was received to request the additional $5.50 to be credited back to my account.  I appreciate the additional amount will be refunded once the return is received, but I don\\'t look forward to having to reach out a second time to close out this process.  Why not just refund the full amount from the get-go and save everyone\\'s time?  Return process is convoluted, warranty coverage is unclear on a certified/refurbished device (apparently it is not covered by the 1 year warranty if purchased from Amazon Warehouse) and while the rep did the best she could, I think there is clearly room for improvement in selling certified/refurbished devices as well as in the return process involved.  I\\'d be more inclined to recommend purchasing a certified/refurbished Fire TV stick product if the return/replacement period was extended and the warranty period was more clear.  Here\\'s to hoping the NEW (not certified/refurbished as I have decreased faith in the longevity of those products now) replacement Fire TV Stick 4K I just ordered will hold out for longer.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI have had a Roku for years and use it a lot for streaming.  I recently decided to try out Amazon\\'s Music Unlimited HD service, specifically to listen to some Atmos encoded music.  I discovered that the Roku couldn\\'t play Atmos audio, so after researching Amazon devices I selected this one that says it will play Atmos when it\\'s available.Well, that should be \"when it\\'s available as part of a movie soundtrack\" because apparently it will not play Atmos mixed music only tracks from Amazon\\'s Music Unlimited HD service, at least not when it\\'s connected to anything that could actually play back music in surround.  Apparently Amazon believes that people who are interested in Atmos/spatial audio are content with fake surround via headphones or a small all-in-one speaker system.  Beyond that annoyance, this device seems extremely buggy.  I\\'ve only had it for a few hours and have already encountered this:1.  Upon initial playback, it reported my system was limited to 16-bits, 44.1 kHz audio even though it\\'s capable of 24-bit, 192 kHz audio.  It was downsampling everything regardless of which audio setting I selected.  The system indicated it had a firmware update and I applied that, and then it immediately had another firmware update and I applied that.  After the second update I noticed that my system was finally recognized as 24-bit, 192 kHz capable.  Oddly, there was yet another firmware update applied about an hour later and after that my device was supposedly only capable of 16-bits but at a 192 kHz sample rate this time.  Nothing else changed during this time, so clearly there\\'s something wrong with this device in terms of determining the input capability of the device to which it\\'s connected.2.  When listening to music, if you scroll to something else the music will keep playing.  Maybe some people like that implementation, but basically it means that if you decide you want to stop listening to music you have to pause it first before navigating somewhere else.  If you decide to go back to the Music app it doesn\\'t actually return you to the screen showing what\\'s currently playing but rather the Music app\\'s home screen.  You actually have to navigate back to what\\'s playing to see it on the screen.3.  The Music app crashed once after I changed the audio setting.  The music stopped playing and when I went back to select the Music app, it just loaded a grey screen.  After that, I had to restart the Firestick to get the Music app to load properly.4.  The menu system is overly complicated for many things.  1/3 of the home screen is an ad.  You can display the audio settings in the Music app but have to go to the Home screen and then navigate to the correct area under Settings to change anything.  With Prime Video, however, you can change audio selections within the app.If you don\\'t already have a streaming device and want this to stream TV/movies, maybe this is a reasonable alternative to a Roku.  I\\'m not going to bother trying to use this device instead of my Roku for Netflix, Amazon Prime or Xfinity Stream, though, since the Roku does what it needs to do.  This Firestick device is going back to the store.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe older fire TV sticks were much better! With this version of the stick, I can't delete Amazon default apps I don't use and there is not enough space to update the apps I do use. I have way more apps on the older FireTV sticks and never had a space issue. As once I cut cable and replaced with Fire TV, it appears it is time to cut Fire TV and rely on my smart TV. One of the older Fire TV sticks that I still use lags a lot and requires frequent restarts, which it never used to do. I suspect Amazon is pulling the old Apple trick - updates to older devices that make them slow and problematic which then forces users to upgrade. But there is no joy in upgrading because there is no space to do anything you want to do! There are tricks online on how to add space but I bought the Fire TV stick for convenience and don't want to have to revert to strenuous measures for something as basic as having enough space to update apps. It was bad enough when the main issue was an unreliable and short term life remote. Don't buy it. It's not worth it. Some of the new Smart TVs have an HD antenna already in place so you have both live TV and access to streaming apps. You have access to Prime Video as well if you still care for that with its forever audio issues - it's the only streaming app that has this problem, but I digress, this is supposed to be my Fire TV stick rant. What does Fire TV stick offer that a smart TV doesn't? Nothing worth sticking around for.\\n\",\n",

The first thing the stick does is install all this bloatware and updates the devices so its patched and can't be rooted.For making smart tvs smart it will do the job for netflix and hulu etc but not much else.

Buttons to the left and right of the play/pause button, and the pause/play button itself, did not work.  I returned this FireTV for cause, and ordered a replacement FireTV.I had my son (a networking technology & intrusion detection guru) come over to see if he could help with the 2nd FireTV.  He set it up, and as I recall it seemed to work ok:  the buttons (see above) worked initially, but then they quit working.  Alexa worked, e.g., to “show weather” or “show comedies”, but not to “rewind 1 minute”.  Disappointed a 2nd time, I’m not sure what to do next.It is noted that the foldout leaflet was printed in a font so small I had to use a magnifying glass to read it -- not good.But now, even though all of the above problems still persist, there is a new development.  When I bring the Sling app into play, all of the problems clear up.  The rewind and fast forward buttons now work, as does the pause/play button.  BUT, only while the Sling app is running.The literature that came with FireTV gave me no inkling that running the Sling app would (just temporarily) clear up anything.  Maybe running other apps (e.g., hulu) would do the same.  It would be easy to just let the remote function properly from the outset, wouldn't it?  Not disclosing that the remote would not work is just wrong of Amazon.  Not disclosing that running the Sling app would temporarily make the remote work properly is also wrong of Amazon.I could remark that Amazon deliberately disabled the remote to force users to sit through all of the ads in a misguided attempt to generate ad revenue for their own advantage, instead of simply enabling the full function of the remote as advertised in their own literature.Will update this review as experience warrants.\\n\",\n",

The battery cover of the battery cover has a sharp edge that doesn't fit the remote perfectly, resulting in an uncomfortable user experience with the one part we interact with. It will almost certainly cause buildup of skin cells in the gaps of the cheap plastic and will look gross within days. Inflation is hard but the remote is the one thing where quality of external materials actually matters. Very disappointed that quality control has fallen with a giant like Amazon.I've held the remote less than 5 minutes and (see pic) there is already visible build up in the seam. The hardware of the actual firestick seems fine and it works fine, but it's like buying a pen and the grip having sharp edges. Please don't skimp on the ergonomics of the one part that users have in their hand.

Get the Max which has a newer OS and some other features that make it worth the small increase in price. OS 6 is so outdated that many 3rd party apps don't function properly. Apps that work great on my Max don't have proper remote control functionality on the 4k stick. Other than that, you can't add a usb flash drive as internal storage. And trust me, you are going to need it with the tiny amount of space you have. With all the Amazon bloatware, you'll be lucky to have 2 gbs before you've installed ANY apps. Why they can't offer at least 16gb of internal storage in 2022 is beyond me. The manufacturing price difference should be pennies and it hampers the functionality of Amazon's own apps which are typically over 300mb and cannot be deleted. If a 16gb version were offered for $10 more, 90% of people would choose to buy it. A streaming stick doesn't need much storage space, bit 2gb of free space is a joke for the peanut gallery.\\n\",\n",

But compared to regular ROKU this is a total waste. It is harder to use, you cannot search for anything, I still cannot figure out how to load channels, it shows you the tab for sites like HULU but none of the controls on the remote can get you to that tab so you are stuck with Prime and Neflex and a few others. Also you cannot switch between it and ROKU. You can run one or the other because you have to use the FIRE stick power button to turn it on and if then have to turn it off and power up ROKU. I suspect that there is a lack of control functions because you are suppose to use voice commands that come with Prime service but if that is the case I still do not see the benefit of this over my old ROKU. After about a month Ino longer even use this fire stick at all. The only reason I have not returned it is because I may have to spring for the $250 to get the movies service.

None of the game 4 game systems lag either. I can literally use this side by side with the Roku and the fire stick will buffer and the Roku won’t and it doesn’t matter how many people are on the network at that time.The house is made up of IT contractors and gamers, we can’t function without a certain level of internet quality. You would have to move an entire office of computers into this home to max out the bandwidth.The isp is not throttling.

If you only stream prerecorded material like Netflix it works good but occasionally the app will freeze and when you exit the app it does not close it. If the app freezes you have to unplug the Firestick to restart the app, but to be fair this is minimal.

Despite having a 300 MBPS download rate the system is unable to keep anything running.  Want to watch a particular channel?  You never really get to see it.  You merely get snippets of a show.  Our worthless internet provider told us we would be getting internet (via modem/router) AND cable tv but they lied and said you can get cable tv with the fire stick device.  Total garbage.  Every time you turn around you have to download another “app” to see anything.  Amazon should be sued for misrepresenting what they are capable of providing.  If you want to watch a particular episode of a series show you have to fast forward through the first xx number of episodes.  It doesn’t take you to where you left off.  You have to wait and wait for the little time out indicator to stop.  It just spins and spins.  Worthless junk.\\n',\n",
