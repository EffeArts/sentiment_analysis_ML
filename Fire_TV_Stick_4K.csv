Merrill,High initial failure rate... but works well,"Recently cut the cable and converted TVs to firesticks. Bought a total of 7 firesticks... 4 at Best Buy for full price ($49.99) and then 3 more on Amazon for $24.99 ea ... 2 of 4 Best buy purchased firesticks failed upon installation (Which they were great about replacing), but it was a hassle. Also note that you can buy firesticks already linked to your Prime account on Amazon (kinda cool and saves on installation time) but they limited me to buying 3 at a time (for some bizarre reason).  One final pet peeve - Firesticks always startup on their homepage... so if you are like me and kept basic cable (for local channels), you always have to scroll thru all the preloaded apps to find the one your local provider uses -- PITA and lots of wasted effort. System should start you up where you left off.",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Works great,"Works great. Not hard to set up. I was able to put the channels I subscribe to up top so I just click on them or use the mic.  I also realized it easier to go to the channel that you want and then search by voice once there. For instance. Voice search from the home page for Guy Fieri brought up one Season of one show. When I went to my Amazon Prime channel first and did a voice search from there, I found a least five shows of his. Anyway it's a great improvement on the old Roku I had. I didn't know you have to plug it in though. I thought the power would come from the TV. Not a big deal though I just use an extension cord to stretch it to the outlet.",5
Paul M,must have internet service!,"Purchased & connected easily to a 6 yr old Samsung 55"" smart TV with only a basic generic subscription for local broadcast .. no premium channels .. which is part of & included from monthly HOA fees. With internet service & wifi the Firestick 4K opens up offering an abundance of available downloadable free apps offering various categories & many free viewing choices without the need to subscribe to satellite channels. All that is needed is internet. Follow included instruction sheet & start enjoying a wide range of available tv.. Links easily to tv and also with Amazon prime. Do be aware app storage is limited to less than 5mb of storage considering some apps seem to be permanently attached.",3
susan l. sedia,Makes watching tv so much easier.,"If you don't have a smart tv then I would highly recommend the Fire stick. Its super easy to get to all of my favorite media apps so I can get to watching tv faster than ever. It's super easy to setup, and there's very little lagging when scrolling through apps. Voice control is a great feature as well, because its convenient to use when I cant reach for my remote.",4
milo,Love the fire stick wish it had lasted longer than 7 months.,Love the fire stick. Although this one  Only lasted 7 months.... we have bought 2 others they lasted longer.  But thats how it goes sometimes.  Definitely going to get another one. Because there nice to have..  have apps all on the stick . Sweet.  Can take with us when we go some were. What's not to love.,5
Kama,Muy buen producto!,"Superó mis expectativa. Aunque al principio es algo difícil entender como funciona, después de que uno se acostumbra todo es sumamente sencillo.ADVERTENCIAS:  1) Si usted está en Latam y la cuenta Amazon está configurada para USA, las aplicaciones que descargue serán las versiones de USA y muchas no les van a funcionar, por ejemplo Paramount+, en este caso deberá conseguir en otra tienda de app la versión para Latam.  2) Si por alguna razón la cuenta Amazon vinculada es bloqueada, el dispositivo también se va a bloquear, deberá llamar a Amazon y pasar el interrogatorio de seguridad para desbloquear la cuenta y reactivar todos los dispositivos, incluyendo Tabletas, TVs, Echo, etc. (todo lo que sea mazon se bloquea). Si luego no se desbloquean automáticamnete, deberá comunicarse con soporte para que lo reinicien y deberá descargar y configurar todo de nuevo desde cero.  Fuera de esos dos detalles que aprendí en carne propia, el equipo vale la pena, las actualizaciones del SO y de las APPs se realizan automáticamente cuando no está en uso el dispositivo, fluye muy bien (poco lag), la imágen es muy buena, el sonido es bueno.  Alexa a veces funciona, aveces no, pero es bien sabido que en idioma castellano ella aún está aprendiendo, sin embargo es funcional y cuando ella no entiende algún comando que le damos, con utilizar algún sinónimo puede que si sea efectiva.  En definitiva lo recomiendo.",5
E sapp,using now with my LG TV,"I have an LG smart TV but still need to use this device.  The reason why is because for some strange reason, the LG content store is really bad meaning, it's missing a lot of apps, off the top of my head, I cannot get Fox Nation or paramount plus in the LG content.  This amazon fire device has all the apps including the fox nation and paramount plus app so I can watch my programs.  The remote easily pairs and I can use the fire remote to control the entire tv.",5
Sergio Cordova,Works great,"My son brought his fire stick to my house when he came to recuperate from knee replacement.  He said that he also takes it on work trips as he uses it in the hotels.  I was impressed at how easy it was to get to Amazon and Netflix and several other platforms.  So I ordered two for myself, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  It is so much easier to use than I had expected and makes life more enjoyable. Worth the money, especially since the first one was on sale.",5
John Lee,Love it!!,This is my 6th one I have bought. I like this one the best of all. I really like Alexa in this remote. Great for the price. They can last so very long. All but one are still in use. I just keep adding them to all my t.v. In each room. Mine was the last room I put a t.v.in. I had never wanted to be someone who stayed in bed watching one for long. I liked being out in living room and basement. I love relaxing in my room now. I will keep on buying this product.,5
GrammaBof5,Losing its Mind,"Over the years, we've ""settled down"" between the myriad brands (Apple, Roku, etc.) and enjoy and depend on the Firesticks. They're reliable and inexpensive. I will say though, that this recent one consistently ""goes to the wrong place"" when choosing something we're already watching or when ""switching"" to another vendor (HBO, APPLY, HULU) through the Fire-stick portal. For example, no matter what HBO show you choose, it will always go to the start of one specific show, and it's a small circus of ""back and forth"" on the remote to get it to the right place. Often shows will go to a season two years past rather than to the latest release. It's maddening. Every week I play the game of having to find the show, click on the right season, and then scroll to the last episode. These are COMPUTERS! And, they previously worked. 'not sure if it's the latest software or firmware, but they're ""dropping the ball"" on the user-interface programming. It's like having a functioning NASA rocket, but it always takes you to Houston rather than the moon.",5
Melinda Koutz,Best version of this brand so far!!!,Installation was smooth. Had to replace my very first Fire stick after 7+yrs of use. Have one in every room. This version is by far the best. It offered to install all the apps I had on the previous Fstick. Can only highly recommend to buy it. Would make a perfect stocking stuffer at this price.,5
W. Lae,Easy set up,"Very easy to use, you hook it to your smart TV, the aps populate, and you log into the ones that are not free. Very easy, simple set up instructions, did it in about 5 minutes. Totally guided set up. You can do it! Just remember you have to pay for any of the aps that are not free. You do have to pay for prime video, peacock, some stuff is free if you have amazon prime but lots of it you have to pay for unless you upgrade your prime service.",5
Merrill,"So simple, Grandma can change programs with spoken words","WE ARE VERY PLEASED with the upgrades since the earlier version. This Fire TV Stick 4K can be setup in two minutes. If your TV has an open HDMI port and nearby USB port, you don't even need an electrical outlet. Plug it into your TV, then follow the instructions on the screen. The most complicated step is to switch the HDMI from cable TV to the HDMI with the Fire TV stick attached. We are impressed and will continue to upgrade as you bring out new versions.",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Perfect!!!!! But……………,"My fire stick was the perfect choice to going to pure ‘streaming’ method.  User friendly. In search engine, search recognition, full menu of equal user friendly access to a choice of other streaming apps while still providing regular television scheduled shows. While i was super pumped about the sleek, compact design of the remote in comparison to that of the bulky, brick style of the first cell phones to its now counter part, the iphone. BUT……. That thing constantly alludes me. I look for it more than i use it.",4
DeeDeeSan,REMOTE ISSUES,"I Loved this product, ease of use was wonderful. Until my remote stopped working. Most remotesstop working in the area of turn on/off and volume, mine is everything else, but those 2 .I have gone to Roku support several times, and even got someone to call me back last Thursday. After40 minutes of trying things, it was determined that the remote had to be replaced, but due to asystem issue, she could not do it right then. She would call me on Friday and place the order.I have recieved nothing and can't find the location to get a phone callback. I got another remoteout of my pocket (to watch the world series!!) and guess how you program the new remote....With theold one!Will never buy another Roku (this was my 4th one) strickly due to the NO support.",5
Deborah Davis,Great for the Road warrior,"I take it with me on business trips and plug it into  Hotel’s HDMI plug on LED TV’s.  One feature that would be better is battery power as sometimes TV’s do not have the additional USB outlet for power. Resolution is great. Controls easy to use. Plenty of Apps.@Amazon, probably a good idea to talk to Hotels and Airlines for easy plugins for screens for the Road Warriors among us and Make a battery powered version.",3
Dave S,Remote stops working.  Two died this way.  Cheap product,"There is a bug that bricks the remote in the latest version.  Dies mid use and never works again.Do NOT buy!Batteries, reset, and remote factory reset nothing works.They pushed a bad update and probably are seeing an increase in sales.Don't buy.  Class action law suit!",5
Jenny,Staying connected,I would’ve liked it if we would’ve had a better instruction booklet describing how to record and how to race retrieve stuff you recorded because the one that came with it does not help at all not me anyway and then I mean I like the guy I love being able to see what’s coming on like the picture quality but every once a while it’s like it freezes and then when you go to Ford through it the ninth of things start moving again it’s like it really skips or sometimes you’re sitting here and as I could all of a sudden it’s loses connection you got the picture and you got that thing sent their twirling in the center and then I’ll send it to connect again but yet I have Internet on everything else,5
Christine Copley,Each generation gets a little better,"This is a mature technology at this point.  Quick, responsive, without profound lags.  I've recently decided to give up being nervous about privacy and embrace Alexa, and on this device it works quite well: hears me clearly, and translates my spoken words to accurate searching.If you have an older Fire Stick, I suggest an upgrade.  If you don't, give it a try at these low prices.",5
J-Man,Super Easy,"I now have 5 of these and love how easy they are to install, setup, and the Alexa works great too.  We recently cut the cord from cable and so far it has been working great.  The Wi-Fi reception range seems pretty decent too, we bought a projector and watch movies in the back yard.  So far no connectivity issues.  👍🏻👍🏻",4
Dan Oldenkamp,"The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K balances functionality, price and performance","As 4K HDR devices go, the Fire TV Stick impresses with its balance of functionality, price and performance, which make it a popular purchase when it goes on sale. Even though it's not the most comprehensive device on the market, (or the cheapest, or the most powerful), those used to some of the standard frustrations with Amazon products can get a rock-solid streaming player at a relatively affordable price.ProsExcellent 4K HDR quality, fast navigation, lots of great apps, an upgraded remote that's better than the non-4K remote.ConsAmazon-heavy interface, requires a really inconvenient power adapter.",4
Jamiprater,Enchance your 4-8K TV,Can't say enough about this product. I was skeptical at first always having a mini PC connected to my TV for streaming my HTPC. The Amazon Fire Stick 4K was seamless in integration. My Samsung TV picked up the Fire Stick after installing and then proceeded to tie in the Home Theater Receiver so I only have one remote.  It also upscaled the TV resolution to the 4k it should be. My cable company doesn't give me that resolution!  The sound and picture are what they should be now.  I bought three more for my other televisions.,5
Conrad.TDI,Superior Product,"This Amazon Fire Stick is simply amazing.  It turns a Flat Screen Television almost to a Fire Television smart device.  Really it has Alexa which is always brilliant and will help you browse through the menus. Setting up is a breeze.  Just plug the Amazon Fire Stick into the HDM1 port and you are on your way.  It hooks up through the internet, so you will need that.  It has movies through Amazon Prime Videos, so plan on spending about a little bit of money on that. Some videos you will have to rent or buy for such a small fee.  Other Videos (and there are a lot of them) are free as long as you are a member of Amazon Prime Video.  Freeve and Pluto networks you can access through the Amazon Fire Stick and they are splendid networks and they free.  They have a lot of great shows and movies to offer, as well as CNN news.  The remote is superior which has a button you can press to talk with Alexa and she will help you navigate through the menus to access Amazon Prime, Freeve and Pluto networks.  I do not know if all the Amazon Fire Sticks have Alexa or not on the remote so make sure you get the correct one with Alexa.  There are other content you can access through the Amazon Fire Stick with Alex's help.  Netflix and Hulu are a couple from others that are too numerous to mention here.  Also, you have to open a free Amazon account.",5
D. Long,You don't have to be in the 'Alexa EcoSystem' to make the most of this!,I picked up the revised firestick after trading in my original stick which had grown somewhat dated. The new revision offers an overhauled remote (onboard audio and power control for compatible TV's + soundbars). The streaming consistency and quality is great even on my fairly poor connection and the device offers a great array of streaming services onboard that don't restrict you to any proprietary platforms. This replaced an original generation Apple TV in my home as I am predominately on the HomeKit ecosystem and I found that all my third party accessories were either compatible with Alexa integration as well and the experience was still fluid casting between my appleOS devices and the firestick. Would definitely recommend as a cost effective alternative to other leading streaming devices. My only caveat is that using the firestick includes a TV set up process that was not able to properly set up IR controls with cheaper TV's and projectors I had tested it on.,5
Merrill,Lo debí haber comprado antes,"Hasta el momento me encanta el dispositivo, toda mis familia y conocidos han usado el Roku como primera opción, opte por el Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K y estoy encantado, me gusta su interfaz es atractiva y me gusto el orden que tiene.La resolución de películas y series es excepcional, nada que envidiar de los Roku y su integración con Alexa me encanta, no es común que ocupe los comandos de voz pero es súper funcional!!! Y sobre todo el extensor que trae por defecto fue lo que me salvo, de no ser el, mi TV no hubiese permitido insertar el dispositivo directamente!!Esto es un 10 de 10!!! Recomendado",5
Mark R. Wietstock,It's made my smart TV even smarter.,"We live in an area with limited internet options and because of data caps we have never been able to do much streaming.  Recently we were able to upgrade to a service with unlimited data so we can now use more streaming services. Our TV is an older Insignia model.  It's ""smart"" but apparently not quite smart enough because it picks up Netflix and Amazon Prime but would not get Disney Plus or Apple plus.  So I took a chance on the Fire Stick.  It works like a charm.  I plugged it into an HDMI port on the back of the tv, connected it to power, and fired it up.  Using the input button on the tv remote the tv found the fire stick without issue and I was easily able to connect Disney Plus and Apple Plus.  It also connected to Alexa without any problems and we can control some functions with either our Echo Show or directly through the remote which has an Alexa button.  The sound and picture quality is very good.  There are only a couple of minor issues that are certainly no big deal.  The fire stick itself would not plug directly into the HDMI port because the adjacent ports both have things plugged into them and the stick would not fit.  So I had to use the little HDMI extension cable which was included apparently because of this very issue.  It works perfectly but it does stick out a little and so the stick is visible from behind the tv which is no big deal at all for us.  Also, we have Dish.  So now, to successfully run the tv, we need three remotes.  The Dish remote, the tv remote, and the Fire Stick remote.  Again, this is simple and not a big deal.  Overall we are extremely pleased with the Fire Stick.",5
Linda M,Works fine.  Same as  my other Fire Sticks,"I only bought the 4K Fire Stick because my LG 65C1 OLED TV does not support the NBA League Pass app.  I could say that this is an indictment of my LG  TV's smaller subset of available apps, as much as praise for the fire stick.I use this fire stick along with the Amazon ethernet adapter for it. It works fine, as advertised, although I only use it for a very limited application.  I do not use voice commands so I cannot evaluate them.My only complaint with all of the fire sticks is they are not backlit.  I like to watch TV at night with the lights out, so if I need to issue streaming changes, I have to turn a light in the room on to see what I am doing.",4
Edward J. Indovina,That sometimes it works and sometimes it don't!,"My emotions are very mixed about this device when I first used it.it was perfectly fine, now I notice that it's taking a lot longer to get a movie going and I noticed that the little logo that swirls around and  round on your TV screen has been swirling for 10 minutes now! and nothings happening so I'm kind of confused about this product it seems like my old fire stick which only veiws  in HD works better.At first I thought it was my Internet service not being able to handle 4K HD  UHD but I called my Internet service and they told me I have the fastest Internet available known to mankind so now I'm even more confused? The aliens were right I think we are depending too much on electronics and I think it is going to be the end of mankind. Because when my streaming service doesn't work like it's supposed to it feels like it's the end of the world! when I was a kid the end of the world was not being able to see Star Wars for the 200 time now it seems like the end of the world is not being able to stream Star Wars in 4K for the first time!GOD WHATS THIS WORLD COMING TOO?",5
John,Faster than connecting directly through the Smart TV,"Hulu was no longer supported on my Smart TV so I bought a Firestick. Now, I run all my apps through the Firestick because it connects much faster than going directly through the TV. I don't use Alexa or voice features, so I just gave it 3 stars.",3
3zz,Really impressive for $25,"I know this Fire TV Stick has been out since 2018, but it's still a relevant performer.  I'm using it on a 32"" 1080p TV and it looks great.  Menu navigation is is quick and responsive.  I have no idea how/if Amazon is making any profit at $25 per unit.",4
Kevin Martinez,Good purchase,I updated my older version of a Fire stick. I like that it can be voice activated and with the push of a button can open a number of streaming services- all features my older stick lacked.Works great with the 6 streaming services we use.,5
Ron Moseman,So much better,"Replace my old firestick (which I didn't think had a problem, but it was suggested it would make a big difference)  Well, it made a huge difference.  Quicker response, I think a better image and I am very happy with it!",5
Mike,Love our new firestick!,This is awesome! We had an apple tv and switched to the firestick. It is so much cheaper. The quality seems great. Really nice picture and is fast. I was a die hard apple tv user but this has me changing my mind.,5
MOREGONE,Totally worth the upgrade better connectivity volume on remote etc,"Totally worth the upgrade the connectivity is better, volume and buttons for main apps on remote saves a lot of time. The fire stick allows me to save a considerable amount of money as an alternative to outrageous expensive cable bills!",5
Sunnie,Works Good,Was very easy to set up. Linked to my amazon account without an issue and reinstalled all the apps I use. Able to adjust volume on TV & turn on/off. So nice to have 1 remote instead of 2 now.,5
Drew,100% better than the Roku Ultra I have.,The Fire TV stick 4K is much better than the Roku Ultra that I have been using. I like it so much that I bought a second one for another TV in the bedroom. No trouble with losing audio or picture freezing up like with the Roku.,5
Merrill,100% recomendado para TV viejas,Excelente producto. Pude darle una segunda vida a una TV antigua. Fue un regalo para mi familia y les encanto. La calidad de audio y video son muy buenas. Me encantan las aplicaciones de pluto TV y VIX se sienten como tener cable pero gratis. Volvería a comprar el producto. Si tienes una TV o un monitor viejo te funcionará para darle una segunda vida.Nice product. It s a second chance for old devices.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Happy.  Used to access Xfinity Stream after they stopped supporting on LG Smart TV,Bought an LG smart TV that supported the Xfinity Stream App which was then discontinued shortly after.  ANNOYING but that's Comcast.  Got the fire stick since we do not have a cable line to this TV and can't get one.  So far we're very happy.  Actually gave us more functionality!  It recognized our small sound-bar so we don't have to use two remotes anymore.  Bonus we weren't expecting.  Don't really use the alexa functionality because it's easier to just speak to the actual echo.  Can't seem to find a need to use via the TV.  It doesn't work within the Xfinity app that we can figure (but maybe we're missing something).  Just wish we didn't have to take up a plug for it but not the end of the world.,5
Kathleen S,Fire tv,I already have one just needed another for livingroom... grandkids don't want to be in bedroom all the time and I need to stay out of the bed. This works great..cheaper than paying for satellite or cable. Just have to worry about internet bill.,5
Barbara B.,Excellent service,"This review is about customer service ,I received the firestick and it said I needed my password to amazon and I also wasn't sure I could set the product  up ,so I called c.s ,I asked them to call me back day later to help with install ,well the lady called back almost 10 minutes of when I asked ,I was able to do all myself before she called ,but kudos to the c.s. agent for her excellent follow through ,amazon and staff are the greatest",4
C Jackson,Helps extend the life of you Smart TV!,"The apps on our smart tv are glitchy. Instead of buying a new TV, I got the fireTV on sale and works great. I love the voice recognition for searching for movies. Paired easily with my TV.",5
Me Lissa,This remote does it all!!,"We finally cut the cord from cable.  Very happy with this fire stick.Will probably replace the “older” Roku we are using in the Great Room. Tired of having to deal with the 2 remotes. The TV remote to turn on/off and control the sound AND the ROKU remote to change channels! Just FYI, we are happy with YouTubeTV too.",3
Emma,"Awesome device for streaming, exceeded expectations","My Vizio TV had a really crappy remote that wasn’t even working anymore. I bought this in hopes that it could make my TV work again and it did! Just by connecting the Fire stick, I can use the fire tv remote to turn on my TV and use all the features (including volume). It’s also really convenient to take with you when traveling since it’s so small. I think it’s better than a Roku.The features also exceeded my expectations. It has all apps I could think of: Spotify, YouTube, all major streaming apps, an internet browser, games made by Amazon, Twitch, TikTok, and more. The voice recognition also works pretty well and reduces how much typing you have to do.",5
Boston T,Nice,"Got this to replace my original Firestick. I was a little upset that the last one started acting up, but they are not expensive and the quality of streaming on this one is so much better",5
Aury López,Hot or miss with Dolby atmos,The reason for my rating is because this device doesn’t work with Dolby atmos for majority of applications. I can only seem to get atmos to work on Apple TV app all the other apps it’s just Dolby digital plus. Pretty disappointed.,5
Kindle Customer,New development with best quality of streaming,"I love to stream the movie, YouTube etc. the new 4K max is a real piece of best streaming product with more bigger storage and the convenience of the remote that can do more than it used to be.Such as pair with your tv volume and few one touch to your favorite streaming media.  Awesome product and reliables",5
Shsaam,Watch anything,"I bought this for my daughter & her husband, they watched a YouTube video to unlock it, & they’ve been watching anything & everything they can. It’s really good & if you don’t have 1, I suggest to definitely get one!",5
Bernie1948,Turns our Dumb TV into a Smart TV,"We purchased this so we could access TIVO (used by our cable company) and streaming apps on one of our TVs without purchasing/renting an additional cable TV box. It works as it is supposed to. Some of our problems may be learning curve but if the face of the remote were more clear as to what the buttons were for rather than relying on memory, it would be helpful. Also, the on/off button needs to be the largest button. When you're watching in the darkened bedroom, it is hard to see/find the right button.",5
Merrill,Upgrade was Worth It,"I've had many version of the Fire Stick going back to the original. Seems I get a couple of years out of them then they have connectivity issues. Noticed when we upgraded to a 4K TV the older version was sluggish. Once we installed this one all our problems went away. As a cord cutter, I really appreciate how ecomonical Prime and the Fire Sticks are. One year of prime is same as I paid for 1.5 months of DirectTV. If looking to upgrade from an older version, I can say yes it's worth it.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Worth the upgrade,Worth the upgrade I keep this with me for travel so that I can always have my own channels available. This has been the easiest fire stick so far. Worth the upgrade to get the voice control and the picture quality is excellent. It comes with an extender for the HDMI to television hook up which is great.,5
Mariana Cadiz,So much better than my old Blu-ray for streaming!  Why did I wait?!,"Why did I wait?  For the half off sale!  This little gadget is super easy to set up and use.  I like that I’m now just using the one small remote.  Lots of streaming choices, more than on my old Blu-ray.  I’m not using the voice/Alexa option now, but it’s nice to know it’s available.  Good product.  Fast delivery.  Happy camper.",5
Nan,My go to device,"This does exactly what I need it to do as I try to cut the cord.  I have a few of these devices and I am extremely satisfied.  I had a Google cast first but has since replaced it.  It does not work as well for me, so I will stick with this device.",5
Dev E.,Firesticks are THE BEST devices.. better than Roku hands down,"As a home theater installer, I have gotten very familiar with several different streaming devices. After getting multiple defective Rokus, I went with a Firestick 4k. I'm never using anything else (except perhaps a Max) from here on. I have 3 in the house and with 100Mbps wifi, they all work fluidly simultaneously. SO much faster than any competitor when selecting apps and 4k programming. Roku simply can't compete.",4
Amazon Customer,Reboot,Have had to  reboot several times. Unplug plug back in. In saying that it's not the stick but local internet service. Had had to upgrade yet but is a possibility in the future.,5
michael,Upgrade today,"We had been waiting to upgrade because I didn't want to have to reformat the stick with the apps and passwords. Our old stick just didn't have enough memory left and it would lag in opening apps. The new one is such an upgrade. It loads without delay. The quick buttons are nice. It formated itself with the apps we already had. We did have to link them using a code and re-enter user names and passwords. Even though that was annoying, it is worth the time in having the processing speed and functionality.",3
Amazon Customer,EXCELLENT STREAMING DEVICE,"I USED TO USE THE REGULAR FIRE STICK BUT.....now i use only the 4k its really a diferent story, is super fast and you can play 4k content.i really recommend this little device",5
CB,Upgraded when old one failed,"Had to upgrade.  Our old one burned out (it was about 3 years old).  One plus on this model is that we can use the volume control.  We have a sound bar and had to use a separate remote (so we had three remotes, which was a pain).  Now we have two, one for the streaming and one for the local channels.",5
D. Waller,Works well on older Vizio TV to get Amazon Prime Video.,"I was using an older Sony Blu-Ray DVD player for Netflix on our pre-smart Vizio LCD HDTV, but firmware/software would not support/update to Amazon Prime Video app.  Fire Stick installation, setup and registration went smoothly.  Have not set up voice recognition (yet) nor Alexa, so no rating.  Just using standard 1080P high-definition and works well over 50MB internet connection.  Nice thing about using the Firestick is getting Thursday Night Football over Prime...for some reason my ""newer"" Vizio TV's Prime Video software won't support this programming - maybe need a firmware update....  App menu systems/navigation are different between hardware types - Firestick is easier to navigate.",5
Kiki,Great product!,Works exactly as expected. My aunt lost the remote to her large tv and it’s a bit older and isn’t a smart tv. This device helped retro fit her outdated tv into a high quality smart tv. We’re very happy with the purchase. She even shut off her cable subscription to use the streaming services and saved about $50 a month.,5
M G Miller,The Amazon Firestick is awesome!,I really enjoy the Amazon firestick. My Uncle Leroy has it now on his television and it is so easy to use. The variety of television shows and movies available are incredible!,5
Merrill,Incredible features,This is the second 4K Fire Stick I've purchased and I can now stream a wide selection of movies and tv programs. The integration with Alexa was effortless and the picture quality on my Samsung 4K and UHD sets are amazing. I am considering dumping Sling since the Fire Sticks offer so much more and include local channels.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,"Great, new product for me",I got this as a replacement for one that I purchased elsewhere that stopped working and since it was an Amazon product they were really great about sending me a new one.,5
Bonnie,My 4k firestick,"Since my dog Tyler seems to have an affinity to fire stick remotes, I’ve had 4 now, I finally grabbed 4k and it is really really great. I’ve solved the problem with Tyler… I place the remote in a dark place on to of the tv. For now, all is good!!! Thank you Amazon Prime. 😆",4
Carl,Easy Installation,What I liked the most was how easy it was to install this on my tv.  My tv is already hanging on the wall and I didn't have the physical strength to take it down.  It was so simple to add this to the back of my television (I hate cords).,5
The Burke Family,A Must Have make to your tv and smart tv,"Really happy with this device, internet is fast and really easy to set up, if you have prime and like to stream movies this is the one to buy",5
DPSQ,Made in China,"Flaw #1 you can only connect one set of headphones or one audio source via bluetooth. However, you can connect your bluetooth headset and bluetooth keyboard simultaneously. A keyboard will come in handy if you have to type in searches or passwords or profile stuff. Oh, and guess what? You won't find anything in the directions about anything related to bluetooth or even on the box. But if you fiddle with the onscreen setting you will run across it.Flaw#2: The directions suckIf your remote doesn't pair with your TV correctly at first just remove your TV and redo the pairing.You can download and install APPS so you can watch movies and TV and you can uninstall them as well. So, if you're not familiar with this, you can download HBO max or Showtime Max and sign up for a monthly subscription without having a cable TV service. There are many free TV apps etc but you will have to deal with ads. ROKU has free TV and movies but you will have to watch a few ads maybe twice during a 45 minute episode of your fav TV show. If you have Amazon prime you may be ad free. I don't know. I don't want to pay for anything or watch ads but I'm dealing with it for now.Flaw#3: The firestick remembers I have headphones paired but when I turn on the device I have to physically go into settings and connect them but sometimes I don't and it will connect them automatically when I turn the headphones on. If I forget to connect my headphones at startup and I go into an APP and start watching a show. I have to go back to the home screen and go into setting and connect my headphones. Then I have to go find the app I was using and go back to my show. The stick doesn't have a recently viewed section that actually works. The problem is there are so many apps that I sometimes forget which app I went into to watch that show. You can however ask Alexa to just play the episode of whatever you were watching if you can remember what you were watching. I feel like this function of continuing watching the show you were watching could be better. You know how everybody likes to binge watch but at some point you have to turn off the TV, right? When you go back the next day there should be a section box that you can click on that shows you what show you were on last and allow you to go right to it. There is a recently viewed section that doesn't really show you what you recently viewed. I call that useless.you have to have good data speeds otherwise you'll never see 4k. I have hotspot on my phone but the data speeds in my area suck most of the time. But I'm paying too much for cell service to buy home internet that isn't much better.Just so you know, this firestick will stay connected to your wifi even when powered off and it will automatically connect when disconnected no matter what. So, when I turn on my phone hotspot the firestick will jump right on and so will my Vizio TV and so will my Laptop. I have to go in my phone and limit my devices so be forwarned.and that's all I know for now",4
Kindle Customer,Great option if you want to cut the cord,"I purchased two fire sticks to replace a satellite feed we had.  Now no more expensive monthly fees, no box rentals, no maintenance fees, just free tv. The Amazon Fire Stick comes loaded with content and you can download lots of apps for either streaming tv or movies. All in all I wish I had done this sooner.",5
Sharon padilla,Nobody told me how fantastic this is,I’m sooooo late to buying this. Got one for my grandma so she could eliminate cable ($300+) a month. Now she only has to pay for internet and she can watch all the movies and shows she wants. I’ve gotten one as well because I fell in love with it. Super happy!!!,3
Jennifer Chaparro,OMG It has a screen reader!,The Fire TV stick comes with a screen reader for people who are blind or visually impaired. It's also possible to switch audio tracks to tracks that contain audio descriptions.I'm legally blind from birth. I'm just accustomed to missing visual information when watching TV or movies. A lot of Prime video and Netflix content has audio descriptions. It was so exciting to start setting up this device and find out that I can fully use it.,5
Beth Lang-Sletten,Upgraded and Worth It!,We had an older version of the Firestick and had to upgrade recently due to the Beachbody App not working with the older one. This newer version works great. We love the features of the quick access to Netflix and Disney+. I'm going to upgrade our other ones as well.,5
Harvey,Great!,I replaced one of the original stick in the kitchen tv that stopped working. This new version is superior to all the others I own (I have 4).,5
Golfer John Boy,Great for the price,"So far everything ok. Nice for the price, made good, good fit, looks nice. I would buy it again, I'm happy with it and it did meet my expectations.",5
Merrill,Alien tech is awesome,"This is perfect for traveling and staying at hotels. Phone HotSpot will work on this device. If you want to play games, you will need a BT game controller. I love alien tech.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,No more cable,I am so happy with this fire stick. It is saving me over $142 on cable. I cut the cord and couldn’t be happier. The picture quality and sound are so much better.,5
trekker,good upgrade,"We have multiple firesticks and rokus.  All the rokus are 4K.  None of the firesticks were.  Makes no real difference on smaller tvs, but definitely see the difference in a large screen.  We bought this to replace a firestick that was probably close to 10 years old.",5
dobetk,Love the fire TV stick,"Just bought this other 4K FIre TV stick for the bedroom TV. I really like the overall look of the OS, over any pre-installed TV operating system. The Fire TV is fast, never had any issues with it. It does everything that I need to enjoy my streaming programs.",5
Fox,Firestick 4k,I had one minor obstacle while pairing. I had another Bluetooth device operating in close proximity. I had to temporarily turn the other device off while pairing was completed. I was then able to turn the other device back on with no problems. Otherwise every thing works great.,5
Deborah,Great product,Fire stick has great streaming qualities and I would really enjoy it more if we had better internet connectivity where I live. This is No fault on the fire stick. I have a Verizon box and a data plan that limits me to what I can watch.,5
Don VanEck,Great streaming!,It was easy to set up. The streaming is great I haven’t had any issues with it loading. My tv is older and not a 4k tv but works great.,5
George,really good product!,"I bought it as a gift for my parents. I think my parents like it a lot. Parents like to watch videos on YouTube, Netflix, etc., and I really recommend this product. I think this product is really suitable as a gift for parents. Strongly recommend.",4
Drew Park,Device Much Faster With More Choices Than IPTV Device,"I like the number of entertainment options available on the Amazon Fire Stick verses my standard IPTV device installed by Broadstar Internet.  There are many free services but also many paid ones I wouldn’t have access to.I also find the Fire Stick to be much faster.  Some options on my IPTV remote don’t work with the device making it uncomfortable to use.  Everything on the Fire Stick works.  I haven’t tried Voice or Alexa, so I can’t rate that.",5
A milli,I’m a fan,"I am a Firestick fan. When they first came out, I brought them from the first edition all the way up until now and continue to use them because I am a fan so my review may be a little biased but I love these things.",3
S. Aldridge,What a difference,"Didn't think there would be a big difference from my old firestick but woe! Huge difference. Better speed, quality if pic etc. Impressive. Love my firesticks.",5
Ashlee Fleming,Works awesome,"I had a very old Fire Stick (like 8+ years?) and we were trying to use it on a TV that was pretty far from the router. Assumed it was just our terrible internet, but it turns out it was the crazy old Fire Stick LOL. Ordered this, plugged it in, short setup and boom we were in business. Works awesome, so much better than we were expecting (with our terrible internet).",5
Merrill,Blank tv screen,"Overall, we like the new firestick.  Seems like an odd coincidence that when we started using it the tv would randomly go into a blank screen. It doesn't seem to matter what we are watching.  Hitting the back button fixes it.  Never did that with old firestick.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Great investment,"My TV is already smart but it’s slow and has a ton of obscure apps. I decided to buy this to use instead as a smart feature. It’s fast, has exactly the app buttons I want, and is so easy to use. Love it!",5
Robert Mcbride,It is the go-to for entertainment,"We use this with our TV at home and when we travel. We also use it for backyard movies with a projector. This keeps all of our paid and free accounts and options easily accessible wherever we are. So easy to use…just plug into a USB port in the viewing device. Especially handy if your TV is a little dated- you don’t need a new TV and software, just use this.",5
Steven,Love it!,I love how easy it set up. The quality of the video is flawless. I replaced my firestick and my only regret is that I waited to long. I recommend buying this. My fire stick was easy to set up because I already have a prime account. All I had to do was plug in my fire stick and everything loaded.,4
Aaron,Kids Mode Beware,"Love that this has so many upgraded features from our older Fire TV model (the little square box that plugs in). If you have multiple devices, it recognizes and helps you set them up. Then you can use the voice feature to switch between inputs. The volume/mute on the remote. And the easy access for certain apps on the remote.Downsides mostly with Kids Mode accounts with Prime. Some of the purchases I previously made (for kids) will not show up as an option on the kid's account. Theres no way to put favorites at the top for easy access. Prime Kids is across the top no matter what, so if you don't pay for Prime Kids, the icons all have Lock icons, and your kids keep asking if you can unlock them. Also the voice button won't work on kid's mode. Back to the switching inputs. If you were on a kid's mode, then switched devices  (ie. Some devices auto switch inputs on your TV just by turning them on), you cannot use the voice mode to return input back to FireTV. Because voice mode is deactivated. So keep your TV remote handy.",5
Golden Eagle,Much faster than my last Fire stick.,"these things are great, we completely got rid of cable, there are a ton of options for free or subscription services.  I have noticed that they seem to get glitchy over time; I replace them when on sale... not a deal breaker.",5
Wally s,Replacement of a defective firestick remote.,"I purchased this remote on May 12 . 2022. It worked great until Nov.12 ,2022. I have done all I can do from new batteries to multiple reboots from you tube. Nothing worked. I am asking for a new one to be sent to me as per your replacement policy. Thank you for your help.",5
Cedric Converset,So easy to setup and use!,"I bought this because the box I normally use had some update hiccups; I concluded this would be a good Plan B. Because I am a Prime member, all of my Amazon stuff was already loaded and setup was as easy as plugging it into the wall socket and the TV HDMI. Then it just worked! I added my other streaming services with ease and now I am wondering why I did not just buy this initially. My compliments to Amazon tech development.",5
llw east,"Awesome, just some minor glitches sometimes.","Remote is comfortable but too simple, perhaps a few more sound options and more apps. Voice search is too sensitive or dont give the right results. For the price it is a great buy, streaming is good and its easy to use",4
Elaine Garrett,Couldn’t be easier !,I lost the remote to my Firestick.  The only thing I can think is I accidentally tossed it when I tidied up newspapers What a pain.  So I got on Amazon to order another.  Couldn’t have been easier or faster delivery.  It was here in a couple of hours (hours not days!).  And Amazon even had it set up for tv.  Just had to plug it in.  That’s all I had to do.  I like this one much better than the old one.  Better streaming and features.  And it was on sale half price!  Thank you Amazon.,5
Patricia,The easiest set-up ever!!,"It took only a few minutes to set up and the remote paired up to my TV by itself!  It was amazing!!  The interface is so easy to navigate, beautiful clear display, and the remote controls the TV power and volume - everybody needs one of these!!",3
jaegeun,So glad I updated!,"I asked a question on here… was it necessary to upgrade your equipment or did it upgrade itself. I got some good and bad advice. The answer is..  although your equipment does upgrade its self when needed, like all electronics, there comes a time when you absolutely DO have to purchase upgraded equipment. I had one of the first, if not the first Firesticks. Most everything was buffering to the point that it was impossible to watch, especially the newer streaming apps. Long story short, after trying lots of other things that failed to fix the issue, it turned out to be my old outdated Firestick. I purchased this one, hook up was easy, and like magic… no more issues with streaming at all! No more buffering, no more resetting. WORKS PERFECT AND SOLVED ALL THE PROBLEMS. And, NO, you don’t have to have Alexa unless you want the voice activation feature. I don’t have have and don’t want or need it. Hope this helps.",5
Merrill,Works well,"I bought this to use on my non smart tv in my bedroom.  Set up was easy.  My internet connection can be spotty at times but I've not had any problems streaming my favorite shows.  My remote also controls the volume and power which my cable remote would not do, even after programming it.  Definitely will purchase again for other non smart tvs.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Excelente servicio de Streaming,Recomendado al 100% para aquellas personas que necesiten una interfaz más amigable para el streaming en casa y como asistente de voz,5
Mike,Very easy to use,Bought this to use on a vacation so I didn’t have to deal with signing into all the apps on the resort tv. It works great. Very easy to set up. Found the Wi-Fi and signed in and away we go.,5
Alonzo Geter,You can control tv on same remote now!,I love all the features in this version of an already great streaming device. You can control the volume and on/off on your tv with this one. I really like how good Alexa is on here as well!! 5 Stars!!!,5
M. Koehler,Really liking the Fire Stick,"The software on the Fire stick is upgrades from what I have on my television. They basically do the same thing but, Fire Stick has internet. Very cool. The Alexa integration is very nice as well. I love being able to speak commands instead of long and drawn out typing on the screen keypad. Mmm, what else can I think of. I don't think the layout is better than previous versions but it's okay. My older system is simpler and easier to navigate. Oh, the internet application is called Silk. I think that about covers it. Lastly is because the software is relatively new it's robust. There's very little lag time and that makes you feel like things are ""as they should be.""I guess that's my review of 🔥 Stick guys. Take it easy and look out for other reviews on other products.",5
Meg,Works great!,Easy to install. I even hooked it up to my Roku TV with no problems at all. Stream quality is amazing. Integrated with all my other Alexa items with no problems at all. I have an echo 5 in my home and once I plugged the fire stick I’m and fired it up it was almost as if it was set up for me. I had to do nothing. As soon as I fired the fire stick up there was my name already on the screen already set up with my items and all that. Seamless. Would recommend to everyone.I find the interface to be a little more jumbled up than say the Roku interface. A little busier I think is the right word. So if you’re used to the Roku straightforward and simple interface this may take some getting used to. But completely doable and after awhile you’re scaling through the options with no problem. But it looks cleaner than the Roku’s kind of cartoonish look and backgrounds. I’d say it looks more adult or executive in a sense.Enjoy!,5
Charlene S.,Es un producto de excelente calidad,"Llegó la envoltura pero no el producto, me sorprende que el repartidor no se percatara de que la funda estuviera abierta y vacía, porque se notaba muy claro la abertura. Gracias amazon por reponer el producto y enviarlo, es perfecto.",5
Evelyn,Great price,I’ve had a fire stick for quite a few years and needed a new one this one is much better then the other one I had I can control the power and volume of my tv with this one,5
Edward E. Grzeda,Just chef kisses !,Honestly money spent right . I give this a high review . Everything is so nice and a decent price . Stream all you like and whatever you like. I absolutely love this . There’s nothing bad to say about it . Also way much cheaper than cable . All you need is wifi and normal Amazon account and your set to go. I save a lot of money with this than when I had cable. My whole family can enjoy movie night now . Alexa works amazing .,5
Gary,ng. Speech enabled♥️,Perfect. Speech enabled. I was tired of typing. Great for seniors (which I am) my son did set it up and got me started streaming ♥️,4
Amy C.,Always The Best,Needed an upgrade for my fire stick and this one is perfect! Pairs well and doesn’t lose connection with internet! 10 out of 10 would recommend!,5
Kindle Customer,Easy to install.,I replaced an old original version of the Fire Stick. This model is an improvement. Very easy to install and works well.,3
Merrill,Not sure it’s easy to use than Roku. Could not  connect to my spectrum provider,It was not as easy to navigate as Roku. Couldn’t connect to my spectrum provider. Tried casting and failed. Downloaded a casting app but still failed to connect. I finally gave up and bought a newer version of Roku and I’m much happier with my choice,5
Mark R. Wietstock,"What? Free TV? Yes said fire stick, and it's true!","Easy to connect. Then enjoy hundreds of channels free of cost, and those annoying commercials. Thank you fire stick. You're fabulous.",5
Barry,A nice upgrade,"We have used both Roku and Fire Sticks for our streaming needs for the last few years and I purchased this as an upgrade for our old Fire Stick. The set up was easier than prior sticks and the interface is smoother. I appreciate having TV controls on one remote, especially because I also have a sound bar attached. Strongly recommend over other streaming options.",5
L. S. Brodsky,OK,"Debated between 3 and 4 stars due to setup.  After I hooked everything up, the firestick didn't recognize my tv.I tried all the troubleshooting steps, still nothing.  I finally tried a different outlet and in doing so, I also accidentally unplugged the tv.  After everything hooked up again, the firestick recognized the tv and setup proceeded normally.The firestick works well and the alexa feature is nice.  The tv controls are limited, only volume control and the tv icon on the remote only brings up the guide, at least on my 8 year old sony.",5
Ricardo Gonzalez,Fire Stick,We bought this Fire stick to replace our old one.  The new one is so much better.  My old one didn't have volume control and this one navigates with the greatest of ease.  Would repurchase.,4
Sandra Long,Great 👍!,"Too bad everything doesn't work as well as these do, I love em! All the free tv you can get and apps, etc for the price can't be beat! Easy to connect to tv and wifi and then start using in just 20 minutes or so! I've got them on 3 tvs and they all work perfectly even when they're all playing at the same time. Great purchase, would buy again and would very much recommend!",5
EMM,It remembers your internet connection & login credentials for online accounts,"SUGGESTION FOR AMAZON:It would be great if the ""keyboard"" had a button that takes you into a window/screen where you could save your commonly used email addresses.  Not just the existing built-in ""@gmail"" etc.  So that you could store several family/visitor member email addresses that are associated with various Login streaming account.  It sucks having to retype the same email address repeatedly.The volume control overrides our main TV/System converter, which is good.The Netflix & Hulu built-in buttons are very handy.We needed an HDMI hub (4 slots) to make this work with our system.",5
Elizabeth Newkirk,Great option for streaming,Very easy to use and setup. All the apps you would need and more. Also if your tv is mounted on the wall there is an adapter you can use to create more room to the side.,5
Devonne Franks,Great TV Fire Stick 4K,"Easy to use/install new TV Fire Stick to replace older TV Firestick.  Amazon retained a couple of the Apps that were on the old Fire Stick.  It was easy to reinstall to the new stick.  Also, New TV stick was able to sync up with the TV and soundbar.  New remote able to turn on/off TV and control volume on the sound bar.  Alexis working well on the TV.",5
Rafael Espinoza,Best Decision to Ditch Cable Ever!,"was debating on ditching my cable company for a long long time- was a bit nervous that I would loose out on some local stations- but this turned out to be the BEST decision ever to get rid of my cable, that high monthly bill and feel FREE!  was a little intimidated at first as I was new to streaming, but it turned out to be so very easy and the set up was super easy as well. I have had NO PROBLEMS since it arrived on my doorstep- looking to get rid of an extra monthly bill- GET THIS... JUST DO IT! you know you have been waiting for it for a long time.",5
matt temple,Replace a Cable Box,I know we are some of the last people with cable but we like it. To save some money we purchased this and put the xfinity stream app on it. Return a box and save some cash.,4
mgriffith,Love it!,I haven't tried any of the extra features yet. I just love how easy it is to plug in and access all my favorite streaming options. This replaced Direct TV for us and I couldn't be happier.,5
Merrill,Works Great!,I had to get something to work with my older tv that couldn’t get the right apps. This works great to get everything you need and the remote makes it all so much easier. Plus using it with Alexa is a great plus to extend one’s laziness even further down the rabbit hole. But it’s great for those moments for when needed.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Works really good!!!,This product was so amazing I’ve been using it for about four months now and the quality was great,4
Marcell B.,Where have you been all this time!,Upgraded to this fire stick and sooo worth it. Works very well and it’s so fast. I wish I would have gotten this sooner.,5
Smitty0803,We Love Alexa!,We had to get this for our new TV -and the updated remote is much nicer- quicker streaming too,5
carlos perez ,Best streamer available,I have to operate off of Satellite due to location and this devise gives clear unbuffered reception… better than any other service I have.,5
laura meci,Didn't disappoint,This is my 1st fire stick and it did not disappoint at all. The streaming quality is very good.,5
Yasmin Teyes,Easy installation,Easy to install just plug and used. It's also really nice that they include the battery within the package,5
Lisa Weathers,Happy Cable Cutter,My 4K Fire Stick delivers the highest quality image I’ve ever had on my Samsung 4K Smart TV.  With YouTube TV as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime…can’t be beat.  Dump cable and satellites!!,5
Beth P.,Great way to watch TV,Much improved quality over previous model streams better remote adapts easily and it’s a lot cheaper then other devises,5
SJ2010,Faster than Roku,"We have the Vizio smart TV and Roku. The firestick is faster and easy to use! Fast download of apps and easy sign ins. The shortcuts on the remote are more what we use, as well.",5
Helen Cespedes,Worth updating to get this one,"I'm buying these for our other two TVs. I love that I don't need a separate remote to turn off and on or control volume. This moves swiftly to the appropriate app, much faster than my old Fire Stick. The only thing I would like to change is if I could have buttons for the apps I want, so I could exchange the Disney button for a Paramount Plus button.",5
Donna kubiak,I like this but i havent used it yet,"I have not used this yet, but I do have a fire stick and I really like it",4
Merrill,Thank you very much the item is working good,I am very satisfied with the item thank you very much everything is working real well thank you,5

Patrick  B.,Great version of Fire Stick,"This is the 3rd version of Fire Sticks we've used. Very easy set up and syncing with the TV. Like the additional 4 buttons on the bottom (Prime video, Netflix, Disney + and Hulu)",5
Bookreader,great product,made my tv into smart tv and so easy to set up and use. would highly recommend.,5
Jenefer S,Good value,"Easy to use, good visual quality, sound is a bit off but i believe its my tv.",5
Cyclone12,Solid for streaming services,Very good for all your streaming services in one place plus make any tv a smart tv,5
David Cruz,Easy to install and use,Just so happen that two of my firesticks stopped working or slowed down tremendously. I purchased two of these models and so far so good! I especially love the volume controls on the remote.,5
Richard J Sajdak,Fairly easy to use,Forced to buy this by our cable company. Harder for seniors than typical cable remote we are used to. Wish there was a way for our cable app to start when we turn it on. Put the cable app in favorites but still requires some getting used to when we change channels or go back to previous channel.  Otherwise it's great. No longer need Roku box for Netflix or Hulu. Lots of free shows too.,5
jake,Great price,"Black Friday deal, Fire Stick were 50% off. Thats a great price so I purchased 2.",5

Kevin,Better than expected,My 2015 LEd tv become smart just one controller for allI love it,3
demarcus,Easy to Set UP,I read many reviews that gave the horror stories of setting this up and I almost didn't purchase it for that reason.  I went out on a limb and bought the Fire Stick.  Keep in mind I do not mess with tech stuff at all because I hate it and struggle with it.  This was easy enough for me to set up on my own.,5
Dee,This streaming device works great!!,"My older TVs didn’t seem compatible with many new apps so this unit was affordable and compatible with my other Alexa equipment. I don’t use the Alexa capability but the operation is simple and reliable for a huge amount of streaming content. I bought a second unit for the bedroom so we can pause and restart in the other room if needed. As you can see, I highly recommend this equipment and Amazon has great deals on the units.",4
Natasha,Works on older tv,I used it on an older TV that was not a smart TV. Just plugged it into my HDMI and followed on screen directions. It gives a great variety of streamingAnd is extremely easy to set up.,5

sergio,100% recomendable,"La mejor inversion que uno pueda hacer. Facil de usar, tiene todo lo necesario para no pagar cable.",5
ScarletsDad,Fun for me,"Why did I not get this a long time ago?  Lots of free channels.  Some apps do require a subscription.  Better than having to buy a ""package"" of channels and content you'll never watch from the big entertainment companies.  You choose what you enjoy and not required to watch unnecessary.I recommend it!  Have not used Alexa yet.  Alexa is not required to use this entertainment product.",5
Merrill,Easy to set up,I use the firestick on my tv that is older. The quality of the picture is really good. I have been able to download all my channels and be able to find them very easy,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Justo lo que pedi,"La integración con Alexa es perfecta, muy fácil de configura y utilizar",4
janetf,Needed one more!,"I already had one firestick that worked great. I purchased another tv so I needed another firestick. I went to the best place I knew I could count  on getting it quickly, in great packaging. I can’t say anything bad about anything I have ordered from Amazon. It is good to get it there on time. If I have any problems they handle it.",5
Amazon Customer,First Experience,First time buying a firestick. I'm enjoying all the features. Great buy.,3
lee hutchins,NO private Listening Volume controls..,"Ok I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K awhile ago out of curiosity in comparing it to my Roku's.. I did not use it for awhile but lately I have been making myself learn more about it and the differences.. everything has been good until last night.. I use private listening in the evenings both to not disturb others and I have some hearing loss and it is easier for me.. So.. i tried private listening with the Fire Stick and after some searching I got to it and it works fine, except.. Some genius at Amazon, decided there was no need of any volume controls. that is very irritating and is a deal breaker for me and the fire stick.. back to the shelf with it and probably will at some point get given away.  NO VOLUME CONTROLS.. Genius..Ok .. edit part.. I did contact Anazon on the issue when I realized I had 2 months of warranty left..  Amazon was great.... After going through some trouble shooting.. they sent me a new Firestick 4k max and it works great.. Even has volume controlling with the Bluetooth earbuds..  4 stars to 5 stars .. thank you Amazon..",5
Rick,Works well,Works like it is supposed to. No problems with setup or use.,5

Vicki Alkire,it is not TIVO,"I am not pleased with the record section. Advancing is so slow and cumbersome.  I guess you do not like us skipping advertisements.  The guide feature with it's dull print, makes it difficult to scan schedules shows to plan your nights programs. Also the guide has no indication that tells if a program is new or rerun, without opening the programs site.  Since installing fire stick 2 weeks ago, we have dozens of {please stand by we will return soon} notices every time we view.  We don't know if Starlight is the problem or if it is the system.",5
Eliecerg ,Awesome,Got 2 of these and just bought a third they work perfect. Dont hesitate to buy.,5

Merrill,Tested Review Vs Google Chrome-It’s on Fire !! stick to it !!!,"Read through this insight and hope it’s helpful guide.Let me start by saying I have few Smart TVs at home and have been using google chrome cast for over 5 years.I landed on fire stick as I have prime account and wanted to test and see how it functionsKey Observations1. Works seamless with Samsung smart tv and LG smart tv2. Alexa voice  on remote in great vs it’s absent on chrome3. You can control tv volume and external sound bar connected to tv through it- can’t do this on chrome4. Processor is fast and smooth user experience5. Value for money, keep an eye on Amazon website as it’s there home product and they run deep discounts on it many timesFinal Verdict - Really satisfied with fire stick and infact have purchased 2 of these now!!Hope this is helpful !",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Works great,"Easy set up, worth getting if you don’t want cable!",5
Tomas Moran,Cut the cord finally,I wanted to get rid of xfinity. Every other month an increase. So I ordered this for my 4k tv. My family streamed for years so this was so easy. It was faster than the other ones we have. Great picture. Wish I would have done this years ago. I highly recommend this product you won’t be disappointed.,5
rachel kaylene brooks,Works,Amzon fire sticks do what I need them to do at a lower price.,5
Lyndsey1220,Send with full batteries please,"UPDATE!After using Fire TV stick 4K for about 3-4 weeks, I have to restart it at least 2-3 times a day. It loses connection and goes dark. Purchasing the 4K was a huge mistake. I’m reinstalling my original Fire TV.This was purchased as an upgrade for my original Fire TV Stick. Had issues installing but realized the batteries sent with the product are dead, hmm.",4
Faith,Second time is a charm,Bought four fire sticks in May 2022. All were working fine .  One fire stick in the family room would go off line without any reason.  Tested one fire stick from another room and it worked thus the reason for this new replacement.  I guess that other fire stick was a lemon.  Hopefully I will not have to replace,5
Juan Rosa,Great for our non-cable TVs,"We don't have cable boxes for all our TVs, but with the Amazon Fire stick we can connect to our cable app and watch cable without the cost of additional boxes.",3
JudyK,Fire stick Fan,"Let me first say I ordered a fire stick that did not work when I plugged it in. Nothing happened. So I contacted customer service and after being on the phone a good bit completing the troubleshooting steps with them, they finally agreed there was a problem and ordered a replacement. The replacement is working fine, so far, as all the OTHERS have. My experience has been that they work great for a while but they do not last long. I've replaced several of them. I figure they're still worthwhile because of what they offer. I wouldn't even consider a Roku instead. So here's hoping this one has a good long lifespan. Although, with Prime Day coming up I still plan to grab another one, at least, to have as a backup.",5
Gail Denise Hinds,Super easy setup,I've had many different versions of Fire Stick and this one has been the easiest to use. Pairs up with your tv controls extremely fast and way easier than the previous versions.,4

M. Bustle,Making old smart TV’s new again,"My TV wouldn’t update apps anymore, it wasn’t as smart as it used to be. So I bought this so I could stream on my 65” Samsung again. It connects to my internet just fine, not glitching, has lots more apps than we’re available through my TV before, and it updates consistently. Basically it will stay as smart as it is suppose to be until Amazon stops updating, or overwhelms the memory space on it with updates. Lol. Then I’ll be back for the new model, so we can do it all over again. Over all works great just as it’s suppose to be. This is my second purchase.",4
Shelia Kirby,WONDERFUL,This is a great remote.  Installation in about 3 minutes or less.  The only improvement needed is it has to be made to open easier to install the batteries.  I had to use a sharp object to open it.  I had the same problem years ago with other fire remotes.,5
Michelle Chamlis,Great experience with Fire TV Stick 4K,I bought it to watch the lord of the rings TV series. It's resolution was very great even with my old TV. The TV Show was really interesting. kkkkk,3

krissy o,Un buen producto ❤️,Es muy bueno gracias por su gran trabajo y productos ❤️,3
Jennifer Nuñez,Great streaming stick,"Works great, I like the user interface. The only complaint is memory is limited and you can't add an SD card to expand storage... Except by finding a method to use a splitter cable and add a memory stick.  Unfortunately this requires using some fairly complex tweaks, and not everything will transfer to the external storage",5
JudyP,outstanding........,best tv money i ever spent............,5
Cbeeches,one of the best items to add to your travel bag,"bought it because we travel alot, and this is a game changer. love it, easy to use, wonderful addition to the travel bag, dont pass it up",5

Mark R. Wietstock,Instant Upgrade from 2 year old model.,"Received it, plugged it in. It updated and once the quick update was done, it was off and running. I have 2 older Firesticks that are considerably slower then this new model.",5
Sassy_007,Works great!!!,I like the layout of fire tv opposed to any smart tv UI so got fire sticks for all my tvs. Even my projector and portable TV,5
Susie,Faster than our older non-4K Fire TV Stick,"Even though we were overall pleased with our older Fire TV Stick, it sometimes was frustrating, in that it would stall or freeze. After a stall, the sound would be out of sync. The new 4K has not had any problems yet. (We have had it about a week.)",5
Laura Scaletta,Stopped streaming my videos.,"My Amazon streaming worked perfectly for about 4 years. Then suddenly the videos won't stream.  Downloading Circle keeps spinning.  After 1 hour + with customer service I'm told I have to buy a Fire Stick to get streaming.  Why that suddenly became the only way to watch Amazon videos is not clear but now they've got my money for this thing.  Fire Stick worked ok for 4 months then suddenly stopped streaming my videos.  It would only allow me to watch the free apps within Fire Stick.  Another 1 + hours w/cust service trying various things like restarting my tv and my router, unplugging the power, etc.  nothing worked.  Rep tells me to call my internet provider to get stronger wifi to my home.  (HUH?)  When I refused to accept that he said he's sending me a  new F. Stick.  then we were disconnected.  AARRGGHHH.  I get back on the phone w/another cust. serv person who tells me I don't need a new F. Stick....I should reset the tv to factory settings and then log back into my Amazon account...WHICH WORKED!  But having to go thru this nonsense ...well it should not have happened at all.  Took nearly 2 1/2 hours to get through it.",5
Cyndy Dudley,Easy to set up,Quick integration. Fast set up. Great features,5
Maria L,FireTv,Good replacement for 4k tv but you have to play with the video adjustments for Disney plus the picture display dark when streaming 4k,5
SA,Awesome picture and options for streaming,You can stream over many apps but it's not compatible with roku which is the only con,4
C. Grant,Replaced an older firetv stick,I was watching LOTR on the old version of the fire tv stick and the audio kept getting out of sync. I’m not having that problem with the 4K version. I probably would have stayed on the older one but I love LOTR and couldn’t stand the sync issues.,5
J Smith,Easy to program and use!,I used it in my RV! It’s made my stay while I travel a thousand times better! Especially because I try to stay safe due to Covid and the FLU that’s going around now. I get to watch wonderful movies and series! Thank you Amazon for your amazing Firestick! 👍🏼,3

Piyush Kamdar,Es un producto excelente de mi parte,La calidad es muy buena para mi función perfecto,5
Becca,This review would have been exactly the OPPOSITE but Amazon came through,"I ordered a 2nd Firestick as we switched to YouTubeTV and the reception was horrible in the Man Cave. When I got it I noticed that the envelope it came in was a bit abused as well ass the box the Firestick came in. Well, I hooked it all up and everything WORKED! Then I went to bed and the next day woke up to find out NOTHING was working!!! So, after screwing around for an hour I googled ""Firestick controller not responding"" and followed the instructions from several sites. I finally just reset the stick to ""factory settings"" and it worked again! YAY! Well, the next day I woke up to find it was worse than before and the remote wouldn't do anything. So, I called AMAZON and they sent me out a replacement the SAME DAY!!! This one arrived with no apparent damage so I hooked it up and got it going. Had to get PRIME / YOUTUBE / YOUTUBETV / NETFLIX / HULU all working from the Firestick remote - and I did!  Having all this and voice recognition from ONE controller was amazing - too good to believe. Well, I went to bed in great trepidation but the next day everything was WORKING!!!!  I can't explain the JOY in my heart that happened after being so freaking MAD the prior one was faulty. I'm 70 and the TV is my main source of life enjoyment and now everything was flowing effortlessly. AMAZON really came through and turned my anger into pure JOY with one controller that does everything. So------- I guess I am writing this to say if you get one that doesn't work CALL AMAZON (the phone number is right on the work order) and they will set you right. I always think it's ME when something goes wrong but in this case it WAS the Stick!",5
Tim H.,bought to replace a year old fire stick.,The previous firestick kept going out on me. I would reset and it would work fine for a few days then freeze up or drop off all together. Decided to go with a new one. Solved the problem.  never found out why the old one was failing. There are reports of that kind of behavior reported on You Tube.,5
Tyeshea,Amazing Product,You can't beat the price point for the quality of the product. I have bought 5 of these. Definitely recommend the firestick with volume control.,5

Merrill,Worked Great.... pleased with sound quality,"My hearing aids were affordable and I received a discount. They are easy to use and comfortable, with a variable volume setting. My order came quickly and I have been wearing them for a year and half. Still working great and I would purchase again.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,First time using a fire stick I was happy with the first one and I bought another one,I tend to fall asleep with the TV on and when I wake up it's on the screen telling me are you still there I think that's good to have because it automatically shuts off if you don't respond by a certain period of time,5
Cecilia B Mack,Much Faster,Upgraded to 4k device. I don’t have 4k tv yet but the device is so much faster than my old device. Well worth it.,5

Jeffry O'Brien,Got 5 rooms on the same program!,"I had a problem with Dish, so I found a local network that covered my local sports teams and WIFI, ""TDS TV Plus"" ,that handled my INTERNET and TV for much less!  Your App came with the install, But the only TV that accepted your app was Fire TV,,,,,so i had 3 TV's that were in a funk!I want to thank you for the access to the answer, Fire TV Sticks!!!  I now have a house system working with @ room having control with FIRE TV, providing ""TDS TV Plus"" to each as a cable internet and TV provider!  Thats Star Quality!",5

EnlightenMe,Lot's movie's,Quality is great,5
Iris,It does the basic job of streaming,"I got this for a TV in the kitchen and wanted something basic and this fit the bill.  I still prefer an Apple TV for any streaming in a dedicated entertainment system as the interface of Apple OS is more elegant and clean.  With the firestick and the Amazon interface, it's a bit clunky.  Of course, Amazon tries to push it's platform of Prime Video so you see that front and center.  Trying to access the other apps (i.e., Netflix, Disney +, HBO Max, etc.) is a bit clumsy through the Fire TV interface, but you can get there with a few clicks, whereas with the Apple TV, all the apps are right there in a grid when it comes on and you can customize it with your favorite apps on the top row.  The Fire TV doesn't allow you to do that (or at least I haven't found an easy way to do it), so would say it is less ""user friendly.""  I also find that it lags a bit at times when trying to access apps.  Other than that, if you are looking for a cheap streaming device on a TV that is not your primary entertainment center to access your plethora of streaming apps, this does the basic job.",5
Cora Frazier,worked right out of the box,worked right out of the box,5

Jesus N.,Upgrade if you are thinking about it,I had the old old original fire stick. And I had a feeling that I needed to upgrade. My streaming was SUPER slow I had to unplug and plug back in the stick constantly to have quality picture. I thought maybe it was my 5G home internet issue. But something told me I should try upgrading the stick first. Voila problem solved 200%,5

george j martin,La unidad que te da este aparato,Me encanta 😊 me convirtió mi tv regular en un Smart TV,5
George,I think this is the best streaming device.,"Very user friendly, high-quality and a very low price given these factors.",4
Susan Misconish,Excellent,Love the auto interface with my other fire sticks and installed apps,5
Alfonso Martinez,Love this unit,"We had been using an older Roku device that was acting up and was lower resolution.  Got this device on special sale and love it.  Really like the 4k quality, the fact the remote controls the unit, our LG TV and Onkyo surround-sound.  Connecting/sync'ing was a breeze.  Also like all the options under Settings including increasing your privacy if you don't particularly want the world knowing exactly what you watch. Note that we do NOT have Alexa (circle back to us not wanting the world listening/knowing what we watch, now add to that the entire world knowing every word being said whether you want that or not) so can't speak to the interface with that (""Asian country"") made spy device.We most definitely recommend this unit.",3
voracious reader,Great,I just hope it continues working as well as it does...love it,5
Merrill,Works great as everyone already knows BUT DONT PAY FULL PRICE BC IT GOES ON SALE OFTEN,Works great as everyone already knows BUT DONT PAY FULL PRICE BC IT GOES ON SALE OFTEN,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Works great,Stream quality is good. I don’t use voice recognition or Alexa integration.,5
Cynthia Leto,Happy I bought one for extra tv,"Purchased for extra older tv that does not have app capability but does have HDMI outlets. The voice recognition is a plus! Purchased at the prime day price, which was an excellent price! Would recommend.",5
Enyel Hernandez,Nicely designed unit!,Nice unit.  It's useful to unplug the power for 30 seconds every week or so to clear the temporary memories.  Can fix a number of probems with slow speed reception.  I don't use the voice recognition option.,5
Jeff Faust,Better picture,Made the switch from Satellite to Hulu.  Thought about getting another TV because we felt the picture wasn’t very good but with the new 4K Firestick picture is much improved.  Very satisfied,5
Joe Bruin,Fire stick worked great to stream. We do not have smart tv’s,Wanted to stream our tv’s and get rid of cable.  Thought we would have to purchase new smart tv’s. The fire stick enabled us to stream without having to buy new tv’s,5
John Murcavage,Firestick +,Bought it since our TV couldn't be upgraded.  Works great.,5
Amazon Customer,Complete television control,Complete television control. The beauty of this device is that we can turn the TV on and off turn the volume up and down and select a program or from one small control,5

D. Kerns,Good device,N/A,3
Merrill,Money saver,Love the many choices we get for just the cost of the fire stick. There are shows we miss from subscription  n May end up subscribing but so far I  love it.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Perfect except for a tiny bit of play in the battery cover,"I got this to replace an older more basic model and I'm extremely pleased with it. I was surprised by the seamless integration with my old tv remote capabilities. And it's way faster than the old one with no synchronization problems. But the battery cover had a tiny bit of play that was extremely annoying. Easily fixed with a little bit of electrical tape, but it should never have been there.",5
Amazon Customer,I love it,"I love how easy was to configure it and that I can also control my tv with it,arrived on time and well  packed I definitely recomend this one over the old version",5
Afrin Hoque,I’m ready for 4K,"I’m still waiting for 4K services. But I’m ready for when that time comes, lol.",5

Mark R. Wietstock,"Easy to set up , good quality","Many good apps available, Alexa is great for times of not wanting to type.",3
Edward Pritchard,Overall it’s okay. I hardly use Alexa.,My sound routinely gets out of sync and I have to unplug the fire stick and then plug it back in to fix it. The fix doesn’t last long,5
Frederick,Awesome!,Love my firetv sticks more than anything else I’ve tried. Better quality and has everything I need on it. Plus I can take it anywhere when traveling like hotels and/or family/friends.,5
James S.,"Bought on sale, love these",Should have upgraded my old Fire Sticks ages ago. They were so buggy and I constantly had to reset them or at least restart them. I didn't upgrade them cuz I kept thinking maybe I was going to get smart TVs but I never did and these new Fire Sticks are brilliant they work flawlessly and they control the TV power and TV volume on all my TVs and just overall work so much better. Very happy I bought these when they went on sale.,5
SEI,"great quality, excellent value",I like that the Fire Stick does not need to be stationed like other streaming devices. It can just go hidden behind the tv. It works quickly and the video quality is great. Its also a nice gift for someone that just got their own place and does not cost as much as other streaming devices so no need to break the bank! It’s a very good value.,5
Shagland,It okay,Still trying to work with it need MORE time no in a hurra,5
Katherine Lynn,Firestick awesome for viewing everything,Firestick changes the way you see tv the price is excellent. Thank you amazon....,4
Gino,I like it,It was easy to install and great product,4
Marisol Padilla,Annoying buttons for certain streaming services!,"I bought my new fire stick to replace an earlier version that gave up the ghost. What I got in return was one that has buttons for Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. It is really annoying to accidently press one of the streaming services I don't use! I then need to exit that and return to whatever show I was watching. May be useful to someone who uses all those services, but I don't and they are annoying! I wish I could disable them.",5

Amazon Customer,Excellent product,Used for Thursday night football. Excellent vewing,5
Shaun Wilhelmi ,Well Worth Upgrading,"Replaced an old fire stick that died.  The upgraded remote makes it worth the price. It controls my old 2006 Insignia TV and my Samsung soundbar too. So instead of turning on the TV with one remote, changing the volume with another and the Firestick with another, one remote does it all.",5
donald wylie,Much faster,A lot faster than older fire stick,5
D_lay123,Works just like it should,just what the wife and I wanted,4
Giselle andrews,remote stopped working after 7 weeks,"i bought this new set of fore stick and remote lat aug. 2  coz our old one stopped working.  I was happy when i got this coz everything works fine.  But today, our remote stopped working. We did all the tricks they’re saying on what to do when the remote stopped working but nothing happend. It’s a waste of money coz this things are not cheap. Now, i feel like i have to buy a new replacement remote.  I HOPE AMAZON WILL FIX THEIR REMOTES AND NOT GIVE US TRASHY REMOTE.",5
Merrill,Satisfied customer,We were so happy with our first fire stick that we purchased another one for our second tv. Now we're going to order another fire stick our third tv!,5
Mark R. Wietstock,It works,I can watch a lot of movies,5
Hannah,Great works good,Works great movies news whatever you want,5
René Grados Fontes,it works great but..,I love the 4k fire sticks. I got a bunch of them. But there is a little problem. I need to download software that shuts down the apps that run in the background of the fire sticks. It is a pretty big problem if you don't know how to fix it. It makes the ram so slow. But other than that. They work great! Just make sure to clear the ram and force shutdown each app to make the fire sticks run as smooth and you bought them.,4
Carolyn,Just as advertise,Product work just fine just as advertised,5
Jan in WI,Speedy delivery,I’ve bought 3 of these in 3 weeks because my puppy finds them and chews thr. Up.This one was the exact item I needed and it arrived quickly!,3

"John A. Webb, Jr.",Nice,It’s a 4k fire stick. Works well,5
Calvin Hobbess,Want an easy way to add a TV to your home at a low cost? Firestick.  No cable. No dish. Just WIFI.,"I wanted a TV to watch while we exercised in the basement.  If I added it to my cable setup, I would need another box from the cable company (additional $10/mo.) and probably a house call for service to change- out existing hardware ($100).  I had an extra TV so all I needed was a Firestick and WIFI savvy son-in-law ($50).",5
April M Neal-Nava,Closed captioning is impossible to figure out…,Cannot get CC working. We use the fire stick to access PBS and love the BBC programming but need CC to fully understand the dialogue.,5

Bruce,Turns any tv in to a smart tv!,"This is great. I have a nice 55” 4K tv, but it isn’t a smart tv. We don’t have cable and aren’t able to pick up a lot of local channels where I am. This little device fixed that problem completely. Now I’ve got access to all of the features I  would receive with a fire tv without having to replace my current tv. All you need is an Internet connection and a tv with an HDMI port. I highly recommend this product.",5
Andy L.,Good,Turns dumb tv into smart tv,5
Blackwidow,Fire stick,Easy to install and excellent reception. Ton’s of movies new releases and order movies.,5
Merrill,I don’t have Alexa Other than the remote.,"I love it. Negotiate with your cable company for a better rate on your Wi-Fi and I use YouTube TV, Netflix, and Amazon prime of course. Cancel the cable and saved me about $100 a month, and that includes adding the service of YouTube, Prime, and my NetFlix subscription. Still savings and the DVR option is awesome.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG?,Wish I would have gotten this along time ago…I had been using Vizio Smartcast to watch Prime Video and Netflix… Smartcast is worthless.. This Firestick works great….,5

tweich,Cutting My Cable Bill,I ordered the Firestick as my cable bill is outrageous. There are a lot of programs to watch. The remote is easy to use. I ordered a glow in the dark cover for the remote. I'm very happy with the firestick and programs offered. I wish I had cut the cable months ago.,4
Patricia Preston,Better than Roku Express!,"Using same internet connection, no buffering with Firestick compared to constant buffering and lost connection with Roku Express. Love using only one remote, too.",4
Amazon Customer,"Goodbye Dish, Hello Fire TV Stick 4K","I was paying over $180/month for dishNetwork watching very few of their package useless channels.  My Fire TV sticks are the perfect streaming devices.  They're small and easily hidden behind TV or HTS.  Fire TV Sticks give me everything I like and more.  I only pay for the the streaming services (YouTube TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBOMax, AppleTV, and others) I want and like.  Having a single controller to control Fire TV, Television, AppleTV, and Home Theater System is a big plus.  I will be buying my 3rd and 4th FireTV Sticks soon.",5
Amazon Customer,"Works great,",Just don't buy the service plan in this case. Had that on my last one and it was no help when the unit started failing.,5

Efrain Vega,good,"it works prefect, happy to watch disney plus",5
Ms. T,The power adapter is barely adequate,"Once I got this working, then it works great.  The instructions tell you to use the supplied power adapter and cable and I was indeed able to get it working that way.  However, if you want to use a longer HDMI cable, you also have to buy an HDMI coupler female to female.  However, using a longer HDMI cable resulted in the TV complaining of a weak signal and not showing a picture.When I tried using this Fire tv stick with the Amazon Ethernet Adapter for Amazon Fire TV Devices, the stick kept re-booting and would never finish the boot sequence.  All the advice online says to use the supplied Amazon power adapter and cable.  However that advice is wrong.My problem was solved when I replaced the Amazon power adapter with a 1.5 A power adapter (can't read the specs on the Amazon power adapter but suspect that it is lower than that).  Now, the fire tv stick and ethernet adapter work flawlessly.  I can use any length HDMI cable I want.So, if you are having problems, my advice is to replace the Amazon power adapter.  I would have given 5 stars if Amazon had included a better power adapter.  I would have given 6 stars if they had included a HDMI female to female coupler.",5
MsPraise,Love it,Works great. Easy setup,5
lawrence dixon,All the fire sticks should be voice controlled,"Love the fire stick,best investment I have made",5
Maria Lukas,Easiest install ever,This was the easiest install I have ever seen. You turn it on and it asks the brand of TV and if you have a sound bar/AV processor and if so what brand. It did it all after that. Now when I power on the Fire Stick it turns on my TV and AV processor automatically and controls the volume on my AV processor.,5
Israel,Needs One Important Update,"This product works very well and is much faster than previous versions. However, would be so much better if the remote control buttons had lights.  It is impossible to use in low-light or dark environments. We ditched cable and now solely stream through FireStick and the only thing I miss is the lighted remote control.",5
Will,It was very easy to use!,I love the fact that it was so easy to use to program the Tv.I love it.,5

Maddog88,Fire stick great Alexa please shut up after a while,The Alexa voice can drive you crazy after a time and is nearly impossible to turn off even after support I tried for hours unsuccessfully. The only way I succeeded is to hit mute and it will not voice back but yet follows commands.,5

Mark R. Wietstock,Actually Free,"We were totally sick of paying 100 plus dollars a month for cable TV for years. I was very skeptical about these new steaming sticks. We had the FireStick on sale at work for 39 dollars and I had an employee discount so I said what the hell and bought one. I love it! Super easy to install. Plug it in and do what it tells you. Could not be easier and it worked. You download a bunch of Apps and then you have access to a massive amount of free movies and television shows. I was totally surprised. You do have to have an Amazon account which if you order anything from Amazon you should have anyway. I also have really good internet service from Xfinity and haven't seen any problems with shows lagging or buffering. I don't know how a slow internet will work with this. The Alexa button is pretty neat also. She actually listens and makes an attempt to do what you ask. Also all kinds of news channels, even a local news app. The non liberal news channels are available which is a requirement for me. One thing I noticed is whenever you download a free app you get a bill statement for zero dollars from Amazon. I always find statements that look like bills to be frightening. However everything has been totally free and they make it clear if it isn't. In conclusion, I would say there is a definite learning curve but this thing is 100 million times better than cable and 100 million times cheaper. I totally recommend it. The only thing you need to investigate is how good does your internet need to be. Great job by Amazon!",4

Merrill,I get what the fuss is all about now!,"I've had Amazon Prime for many years now and could never understand why anyone needed a firestick. However, recently a family member gave us a rather nice, used tv that was excess to their needs and so I began exploring cost effective ways to set it up without paying for additional boxes or subscriptions. I don't know if the price has come down, but I was amazed at how inexpensive it is to purchase a firestick. So, I took a chance and ordered one. I'm an old fart and not particularly savvy on new tech, but I was able to easily set up our new, used tv to receive all of our many subscription channels, as well as our regular television channels (by downloading the 'Anywhere' App.) Additionally, the remote that came with the tv had gotten misplaced, but was no longer even needed, because the remote that came with the firestick synced flawlessly and does it all. It even has voice  control that allows one to simply say what you want to watch and 'voila' it is available. Best of all, this feature does not require that I address a non-sentient, critter-assistant, named A...a, preparatory to using voice commands. Another amazing benefit is, that other than an HDMI port on the tv, a two socket electrical wall outlet was all that was needed to hook this puppy up; no unsightly, visible cables or cords aesthetically bumming me out.  Again, the tv and firestick worked seamlessly together to get up and running with minimal brain cell calories expended. Easy-peasy!",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Got rid of my Google.,Love this. This is easy to use and set up. The picture quality is great.,5
Tomas Alejandro,Love having all apps in one place!,"Bought the stick to get Disney+ and very happy to have a ""go to"" for all of our streaming apps!!",5

Russell Thomas,I like the speed,I love the speed . It loads very fast compared with my old one,5
Joanne,Does what I needed,"My google chromecast streaming device I was using for ""youtube tv"" failed on the volume control within a month of purchasing it. That meant I had to use 2 controls to watch tv.So I decided to try this unit instead. So far it is working out although there are slight differences that are worth noting.I have not been able to get my firestick to automatically come up on youtube tv. So I have to go through options and pick the app. The chromecast device did allow me to turn on the tv and have it come up on the youtube app. I have not used the voice controls at all and I consider most alexa types of devices to be too invasive. I have no desire to have apps or devices monitoring my activities and constantly making suggestions to ""help"" me. If I didn't ask then don't suggest. Oh well, it is what it is, I just am not comfortable with the constant monitoring of my usage so I don't use it. Probably doesn't make any difference since my usage is most likely monitored whether I want it to or not.Anyway the device is working fine so far.",3
William H Good,Much faster than our older stick,Our 3 year old stick was glitchy locking up and saying our internet was slow.  Seems the newer apps take up more space.  This definitely fixed that and it’s great with no internet slow errors anymore.,5

Anita Lashley,Never an issue thus far,"Have yet to have isdues with any of my three firesticks. I do dislike the Prime video page when you log in due to mixing of free vs paid programming, but its a minor inconvenience to just log into whichever app I want.",4
Facu S.,Have 2 of these and they work great,Works great with Alexa,5
John Schonher,Remotes cheaply made!,This product is would be fine except the first one we purchased in September this year the remote stopped working properly! We purchased two more of these on sale just for the remotes! Update: Two of three remotes erratically stop working! Change of batteries has no affect! Not acceptable!,3
Merrill,"Good product, for streaming, cable and emulation",Recommended,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Takes time to get used to.,I got this product from Sparklight when they switched from Cable TV. I can still keep all  my cable channelsplus I added streaming for Netflix and Peacock. I am very pleased with the Firestick.  In the beginning I hadseveral connection errors show up on my screen but they seem to have stopped. So far so good.,5

Merrill,It works great w my 2015 smart tv,I wasn’t sure if this would work well with my older (2015) Samsung smart tv .. but it works great!!!  I don’t use the voice / Alexa features so I can’t comment. But it’s def worth the price compared to buying a new Apple TV (which is what I was using before switching).  I would recommend this.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,This is How Well Every TV Stick Ought to Function,"After years of frustration with Roku devices, including the integrated Roku TVs (I own 3 of them), I finally decided I'd had enough. It seemed that I was constantly fighting to even get the remote to work properly, even with new batteries. The streaming quality wasn't good, often freezing, and having to cold reboot the system often. In addition, the menu structure for Roku is awful.Enough of the old, one with the new!Because I've been so pleased with my first Fire TV 4K Stick for almost a year, I purchased another and finally tossed the Roku Stick on my plasma TV. The Fire TV 4K Stick provides pretty much everything I ever wanted in a simple and easy to use device that's intuitive, has a great menu system, includes Alexa and other voice controls, and controls my TV! That last part cannot be emphasized enough, not having to switch back and forth between remotes is so nice.Even though my TVs aren't 4K, I figured the enhanced capabilities would help the streaming quality, and I'm very happy with it's performance. Now, the menu is loaded instantly when I power up the TVs, so very different than the experience with Roku.If you're trying to decide which TV Stick to purchase, I feel you can't go wrong with the Fire TV 4K Stick, it's absolutely everything all TV Sticks ought to provide, at a price that's very competitive. The reliability of the first one I purchased has been excellent after a year, and I expect both to continue to work well. I may have to buy two more for the other TVs in the home to completely purge Roku!",5
Gene V.,Todo funciona correctamente,Llego rápido y funciona según lo descrito,5
Howard Schilling,Muy buen precio,Exelente,4
Damaris Julbe,Firestick User,"First time using a Fire Stick TV and I love it. Nothing like it so much better that cable, you're not paying so much for channels that you're not watching. I will never switch back.",5
Ronald Galarraga,The price is very low to purchase the Amazon Fire Stick 4K with latest Alexa Voice Remote,"We purchased an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote. It was very easy to set up. We used to have cable TV, then Dish Network, and last, we had Directv. We don't have any of those anymore because they were getting too expensive. So, we now only have (YOU TUBE TV) we have a smart tv plugged into the fire stick. So, purchasing the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa Voice Remote was the best decision we ever made! We love how you can ask Alexa to tune to whatever channel you want to watch. But Alexa doesn't understand channel numbers. So, you have to ask Alexa to Tune to (such as) CBS for channel 4 or like to Tune to TCM for channel Turner Classic Movies; and so on. We also can use the Alexa Voice Remote to get to other choices like Netflix and other choices of streaming services to watch. We also like how our new Amazon Fire Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa; controls all of our remotes. We used to have to have one remote to turn on and off the tv; one remote to turn on and off our sound bar; and still another remote to turn on and off Directv. Now Alexa remote turns all of them on and off; besides changing channels; volume control, and recording programs, movies; tv shows, and then by playing them back and you can use the fire stick remote to fast forward past the commercials by only one remote from our Amazon Fire Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa remote! You only have to record one time. then Alexa remote will just keep recording all of the streaming that you record it to do. The remote can also stream music channels to listen too. Thank you, so much Amazon!",5

Gen,One Less Remote,"I decided to use an older TV for my office and ordered the Fire Stick for it.  While setting it up, I was not able to find the remote for the set!  Thinking all the effort was in vain, I opened the box for the new Firestick and realized that it integrates with the set so that I don’t NEED the TV’s remote!  Thanks for integrating the stick with the TV and reducing the number of remotes floating around the house.",5

Kelly Hoy,Still Issues with Disney +,"This unit is 5G network capable. It stuggled with running those rates according to Ookla. Router was about 20 ft. away. Good signal strengths near the unit as checked on other devices at 5G. Switched down to 2.4G and it was more stable (less intermittent pixelation of images). Disney +  had the same issue as the 1st generation Fire TV Stick with unable to connect errors. Worked with DIsney to get it to work. I had to completely uninstall Disney App, reinstall everything from scratch working with Disney on phone and eventually got to work. I don't know who's fault it is, but I have it working now. No issues with any other apps that I use on a regular basis.",5

Jonathan Santana,Brought my old HDTV back to life,"I have an older Samsung HDTV and it had lost a lot of its smart features due to upgrades in modern technology. This fire stick brought my television back to life and brings us more of a modern day viewing experience. It works great for casting from the phone and the picture quality is superb.

Amazon Customer,HOW TO FIX -----------------ATMOS -----------------FOR MANY RECEIVERS!,"I've spent a ton of time trying to figure out why my receiver gets confused (Onkyo 676) when I try playing anything Atmos on my Fire TV Stick. I have to downgrade to DD+. It always works fine with 4K Blu Rays, why not the Fire Stick?On the receiver (I assume this is true for any receiver with AccuEQ since it's on many), hit the ""quick menu"" button. Go to AccuEQ. Then turn off Cinema Filter. Done.That was it all along, one stupid button. I've tried new HDMI cords, messing with CEC and ARC settings, thinking it was my TV confusing the receiver, thinking my receiver wanted to see Atmos certified speakers (when I have height speakers that aren't Atmos), etc. None of that, just one setting.",5
Merrill,The best invention yet,This is a great little device that give you tons of pleasure and entertainment. The technology is great and the price is right. The Amazon Fire-stick is a must of for all.,5

I canceled my Spectrum cable (went over to Sling for which I have other comments if it comes up for review) and wanted ESPN for the Fire TV. It's in the app store and it let me download. But I was not able to activate it because I did not have Spectrum access. Same catch 22 applies to other apps as well. Am keeping the device as it allows me to stream 4k movies in Prime which I could not otherwise do.",4

Huggster,A 5-star device now ships with a 3-star remote with useless buttons,"We have several of the earlier model of this product, and I must say it is quite good. But I just had one of them die on me, never to get past the boot logo, so I was hoping to be able to purchase this earlier model again. But this one is the only model now available, and it suffers from Roku syndrome, meaning it has useless buttons on its remote that are non-programmable shortcuts to app subscriptions that we neither have nor want. Well, we do have Prime, but the other stuff is useless, especially since we have no trouble downloading any app that we do want. I had dared to hope that Roku had learned their lesson early on with their useless remote button crap when they had the Rdio button and Rdio went the way of the dinosaur. But no, they keep right on doing it to this day, and now it seems everyone including Amazon has jumped on the bandwagon without even thinking about end users possibly not having or wanting subscriptions or companies discontinuing apps, which happens all the time. Here's a thought. You'll get a star back if you give us back the older remote that just had volume and power buttons on it, or maybe add some channel up/down buttons and an input switcher to take the place of the useless non-programmable subscription buttons. Of course simply allowing end users to program four of their favorite apps to these shortcut buttons would certainly make them useful as well, and would be a very good selling point for these newer devices. Meanwhile, although the 4K Fire Stick is a really good device, I will look elsewhere to replace the 2018/2019 model I had that died, and we will just keep right on using the rest of these older sticks until they also die or stop supporting the apps and subscriptions we do have, which incidentally don't have non-programmable buttons for them on the new remotes.",5

Barbara Maloney,New style remote.. otherwise it’s the same.,"I don’t write reviews often, but I learned a few tricks that solved issues I’ve had over the years. I hope this helps others with seemingly unsolved issues with firesticks.Firstly I’ve been using firesticks even before 4K TVs and they’ve almost always have worked well. The occasional restart/reboot on older models were something my family got used to. I eventually replaced all older units with this 4K version. And now never have to reboot. Although this has slightly better remote function, it’s essentially the same as the 2018/2019 version. The 4K Max has the spec bump and quicker less congested WiFi 6 configurations.Okay, so my biggest gripe with the firestick had to do with it not always playing HDR or Dolby Vision, which defeats the purpose of it being a 4K model. I’ve scoured tons of forums and looked at countless YouTube videos regarding this. But either the solutions didn’t work, or they would only be HDR 10 when the nicer Dolby Vision was available.SOLUTION: Make sure your 4K tv setting are set properly. Go into “INPUT” settings and find the HDMI input you’re using for the firestick and depending on your model make sure “UHD” is toggled on. This solution finally allowed every content I’ve played on all streaming services to finally play Dolby Vision content (and HDR when DV was not) every single time. I hope this helps.",5

Merrill,Very Good Fire Stick,"I got this cause my 3rd generation fire stick was giving me all kinds of problems,from buffering issues to the voice not paring with the actors voices.It was very easy to set up,one of the features I liked was the paring of my Blue Tooth Sound Bar,it gave me a list after my TV sound couldn't find the sound.I don not have a 4k TV but the picture on my Samsung Smart TV is great,I see some improvement of the picture.The only problem I have intermittently (Why I gave it 4 stars)is sometimes I have to go back because again the voices are not in tune with the people speaking.But after I re-start the movie news program,etc.Everything mates.The remote is 100 times better than the last remote (2nd generation) I can control the sound bar from my chair,mute it,go to Prime all in one remote.However I have another Samsung TV that I use as a monitor for my computer and sometimes it shuts or turns on the TV.I definitely recommend this Fire Stick.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Fire - Smart,Took my hubby's 'outdated' Smart TV & made it SMART again!! 🤣🤣,3
Nancy Warner,Everything is awesome till today,"So, I had 2 previous models before and one just broke and the other one’s remote also broke from itself, so I told myself to try a better model and purchased this one on Nov 7th, 21.Well, it is not even a year! Today started to acting up just like being controlled by someone else remotely. Scared the hell out of me. Did every troubleshooting I know, factory reset and still acting up. It is moving between apps from itself, went to Hulu to register a new acct, kicked me out of Netflix on TV and tried to log me into it on the stick. Factory reset didn’t help.It is either preloaded with a virus or a glitch in it's system that can’t be fixed.Now. Back to my old one using the new remote and hoping it will last a little longer.Advise: if you are thinking to buy, don’t be fool like me, buy a protection plan as well.Update: contacted costumer service and they will replace it with a new one and will send the old one I have back to them.Upgraded the stars to 4",5

ohodoyan,Easy To Figure Out,Mostly easy to set up...once I plugged it in the correct HDMI port. I would have liked back lit buttons so I could see them in the dark when I'm watching at night. Make sure you have your laptop handy. It's much easier to sign on to the various apps on a laptop than a phone. I like the Alexa feature...sure beats scrolling through hundreds of shows to find one.,5

L. Clark,One of the best around,"Given the choices of streaming devices, I think for price-to-performance, the Amazon Firestick 4k is one of the best you can get. You have the ease of it being an Android device where you can install/sideload apps and the interface is not bad at all and easy to use.You could subjectively find a 'better' option than this, but it will cost you a bit more and the difference isn't all that much. I'm satisfied and ticking with this!",4

Tripp,Old Fire Stick remote failed again 3x so Finally upgraded- WOW!,"My wife was blown away with how much clearer, brighter, and vivid the picture was once we installed this 4k Unit on our at least 7 year old 42"" TV.  With an Amazon Show about 3' from the TV I don't know how much I need the Alexa button on the remote but I suppose if we want to be one step closer to Orwell's 1984 sure, why not...  Except, will it be the government or corporate tech giants that invades our lives?It has been proven not only if you put a frog in boiling water it will immediately jump out, but also if you put one in tepid water and slowly raise the temp they will also eventually jump out.  But human beings are just being lulled into this... sure, I'll gladly sacrifice my personal space for you to know all my discussions, internet activity, where I go and for how long at each location, soon to integrate my health details and all, not to the government but voluntarily to all these various tech companies.  But I digress; Overall, we are happy with this upgrade.  Bring on the fact there are more IOT than heartbeats in my house now.... by a factor of 4.",4

Robbie J Rice,An improvement over my old FireTV,"So after a couple years of use, I needed to upgrade my old FireTV stick (2nd Gen). It was running out of memory for the apps. Also the stick always glitched here and there because the processor was being stretched to it's limits. So I decided to upgrade to the 4K Fire TV Stick and was getting a discount that made the cost less than $25. Had this stick now for a couple months and I am very happy!What an improvement to start! Menu flowed faster, WIFI drops were non-existent and videos didn't lock up as before. That's because the CPU was improved (from an older Quad-Core 32bit that ran 1.3 to an improved CPU that runs at 1.8Ghz) and the memory is doubled (1GB to 2 GB). Did I mention there isn't a re-learning curve as the menu system is pretty much the same?The best thing, is the process to reload the apps from the one to the other is one shot. Unlike when you get a new computer and have to reload your programs or apps one at a time manually, the Fire Stick will do it for you when you attach it to your account.  The only thing it didn't remember was the previous Stick's settings.Now with all that said, I did run into a problem.... the remote wouldn't program. But I was able to use my older remote and had a chat session with customer service. 20 minutes later I had a new remote being sent (1 week) and when I got it, worked like a champ.Now I'm ready if and when I have to replace my TV to 4K :)",5

Amazon Shopper,great quality,"works as it should, easy set up",4
Linda Sharp,Works great in my shop,Alexa is wonderful. I'm kinda lazy and she helps me out lol,5
RD STL,Awesome product!,I own a Google chrome cast and the fire stick is 10x better in every way.  It’s truly intregrated with all the apps I want and need and the remote glkeeps me from having to cast from my phone and then use the phone as a remote.  Basically turns any device into a “smart tv” with voice recognition.  I can’t imagine using the Google chrome cast ever again — it will just sit there……and gather dust in a drawer.,3
Jeff Knight,Muy buena opción pero problemas con HBO Max,"En general estoy muy contenta con el fire stick. El tiempo de envío y la calidad de la imagen son muy buenas. Vivo en El Salvador y solo hay 2 aspectos que me gustaría que merjoraran:1. Que los perfiles guarden la configuarción para cada streaming, pues cuando cambia el usuario que está viendo, todos los perfiles de los streaming, de la última persona que lo utilzó, quedan guardados.2. El problema con la instalación de HBO max fuera de USA.Por lo demás, todo bien",5
Debra W.,Dejó de funcionar después de los 3 meses,"Mi problema es que dañó muy rápido. No tenía idea cómo hacer la reclamación del producto porque la fecha de cambio había pasado, pero quiero saber si Amazon puede hacer algo al respeto aún ya haya pasado la fecha de devolución.  El fire stick 4K está intacto en su caja y el protector que le compré",5
Merrill,Works great and we couldn't be happier.,"We should have upgraded a long time ago, but I am glad we didn't because this upgrade is all that we need.  Easy to navigate and shortcuts are on the remote.  So easy my 4 year old can work it.  And way faster than our two year old previous model.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Really like,I really like this.  I had an Apple TV unit but didn’t like it at all so I bought this fire stick and am so pleased.  It’s so easy to use and responds to my voice which makes it even easier to use.  I highly recommend this fire stick.,5

Merrill,The Remote doesn’t work!,"It won’t turn the tv on/off, change the volume. I tried to fix it but could not.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,I have streaming once again!,"Many months ago the streaming function of my ""smart"" tv ceased to work, and I was told that when that happens, it's so costly to fix that I might as well buy a new tv. But all the other tv functions worked just fine, and I couldn't justify that option. Someone said, ""Just buy a Firestick and you'll have streaming"", so I did. Mind you, being older and not tech-savvy, it then took me 3 months to get up the courage to unpack the item (lol) and see if I could figure out how to set it up before having to ask someone else (like my grandson) for help! YouTube to the rescue- and after following the directions they gave, I was quite easily able to get the Firestick streaming off and running, yay! Oh, there was something about Alexa and voice command, but I'm happy to save that progress for another time.",5
Student,Works well. Must admit impressed.,Works really well. Was a cinch to set up. Very responsive.,5
Amazon Customer,Better than Apple TV,Like: Able to stream selections uncensored vs. Apple TVDislikes: Goes thru periods of buffering during streaming vs. Apple TV. Need a better remote with a pressure sensitive pad for easier navigation.,5

Madelyn Tagliaferro,Awesome!,"So much better than previous streaming, should have changed sooner!",5
venuscaptain,I love it!!!,I was a little worried at first to get the fire stick because I read reviews before I make a decision & I did see some bad reviews but they didn’t outweighs the good reviews. Glad I made the decision to get it cause I fell in love w/it at first command lol ! & it was a sale going on at that time too! It all worked out perfectly! 💙,5

Amazon Customer,"Good, but miss some cable features","The picture and the sound are excellent, but I do miss not being able to punch in a channel number as we did with our cable.

Des,I am enjoying Fire Stick and especially the 4K aspect really clear love it,I disliked the frequent buffering but I like the variety of shows and movies and you can ask Alexa anything she will get that program for you.

Joyce Barnes Bynum,Not ready for prime time,The light itself is a little --smaller than expected but perfect for a night light or around your entertainment center.,5
china beats,Much improved,We have several Fire Sticks and the latest one is quicker and more responsive. With the previous ones after a year or so they would get slow. So far this one has been great. Also the addition of the Apple TV app is a huge bonus so you can watch Apple TV+ shows on the Fire Stick,5
Scott,beautiful pictice,amazing picture and sound,5
Nathan patt,Device works just as advertised. Very easy to use and really zero complaints.p,Very easy to install and set up. Very easy to use. Streaming quality is superb. Device works just as advertised. I have one on four other TVs with no issues,5
Rem Lou,Love it,"Ordered this because I have an older TV and it doesn't have an HBO Max app. It was very easy to set up and I love the remote for Fire Stick way more than my TVs remote. Though I wish the home button was not so close to the Play/Pause button, but thankfully if you hit the home button you can easily go back to the app you were watching on and resume your video.",5
Mike Weese,Easy,Great product great prices,5
Heather Davis,Easy,I like the fire sticks have 4 in my house now. Second one I bought remote went hay wire but others are doing fine,5

Mohamed Safwat,Faithful,Have 4 of them and love them all!,5
Belkis,4k Firestck,I enjoy using my 4K Firestick. I really thought my family & I would have be going through cable withdrawal. Using the 4K Firestick took sometimes getting adjusted. Using the 4K Firestick made the adjustment subtle and smooth transition. My husband enjoys speaking the channels into the remote. We don't anything that uses Alexa beside the remote.,5
Amazon Customer,everything,"I have no review, this is my first time trying something like this . I have a 10-year-old tv which means it is not a smart tv. So  I thought I would try one of the gadgets to have more choices to watch on tv, it's been fine so far.",5

Wildthing33,It's OK,"As a long-time cord cutter, here is my review. I'm comparing to my older Roku(s) here. Going to state up front that I'm in a rural area and my Internet occasionally gets sketchy.Pros: It offers better bandwidth management options, especially for Prime video. This is the main reason I attempted to ditch my Roku(s). (Unless you have a nice router, a Roku will just stream at the best quality it can, regardless of how much bandwidth it is sucking up, especially for Amazon Prime).It's fairly snappy, running circles around my Roku.The Fire TV will pause if you set a sleep timer on your TV. This is great because the Roku would keep right on playing if your TV turned off.All, in all, for the money it is a solid device.Cons: During the occasional storm and other events, my Internet has gone out for a few days or so. When the Internet goes out for the Fire TV, it is pretty close to being relegated to a fishing weight.This isn't totally the Fire TV's fault, but the Plex TV app on Fire can't connect directly to a Plex Server. And even if it did, if there is no Internet, you can't get to a single %#%$#^% app on the Fire TV.I did discover that you can screen cast to it with no Internet, but you know what doesn't work with screen casting to a Fire TV? Amazon Prime (and I'm casting from my phone, which a lot of time still has Internet).The Plex app on Roku will let you use your Plex server even if the Internet is out (for the most part).I have a pretty good investment in my Plex server and have had to keep all of my Rokus on because they work much better with Plex.I was really hoping for a Roku killer and I would be done with the bandwidth sucking devices. Unfortunately, the Fire TV did not allow me to do that, so here I am with two different boxes now.Actually, because I just moved to a cell plan with unlimited Internet, I also have a Chromecast because streaming through my phone works better than my home Internet at the present.To date, I haven't found any Chromecast app on the Fire TV that I like, and even if there was one, it wouldn't work if the Internet goes out...because you can't get to a single app on the Fire TV without an active Internet connection. Like I said, the Internet goes out, it becomes a fishing weight.So here I am with three devices, and the Fire TV gets three stars because of that.------------Update: I did find after searching the Net that there is a way to launch apps on the device if your Internet is out. It's not obvious at all, but it isn't too difficult. On the Roku, you can get to all your apps normally, but they will warn you if there is no Internet. On the Fire TV, you have to dig through a bunch of menus in the settings.So, I came up with a setup I'm happy with. Turned on DLNA on Plex and installed VLC app on FireTv. I haven't fully tested this, but it should work to stream movies to my TV in the event of an Internet outage.Also installed VLC android app on my phone. From the Fire Tv or my phone, VLC was up and streaming movies with just a few button clicks. Now that's the way things are supposed to work. Good job VLC team.",5
Merrill,Awesome!,"I truly love Alexia! So amazing how she turns TV on an off, goes wherever you ask. Just amazing somewhat erie 😊",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Works,Cheaper than cable,5
Magdalena,It WORKS,It's soccer season. My husband wanted to see Italian soccer. The Italian channels have not shown Italian soccer for years. Finally with the fire stick he is able to stream and watch match replays. He is one happy Italian man !!,5

IVAN VILLAVICENCIO,Nice But Could Be Better,"I find the streaming function to be excellent, but the interface is clumsy, confusing, and unfriendly.

Susan,No Other Option / Choice,"I have a 8 year old 65"" flat screen that you guessed it was outdated the moment I left the store with it.After years of not being able to update or add new  apps I had no other option other than to buy one of these.Pros: a lot of apps to choose fromCon: pray you never have to reset it. I have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting any information from a customer service rep.And wow Amazon a billion dollar company can't even use accurate images of the product on the instructions page.Remote: Can't stand that it isn't backlit. I don't know anyone who watches TV with a ton of lights on. So you can't see the buttons when watching TV at night.I wish the TV mfg were forced to figure a way or build a better TV. We shouldn't have to buy 3rd party sticks to add the ability to steam apps that are on new TVs.",3

Mark R. Wietstock,Doesn’t work well with Samsung smart tv,I’ve found that the fire stick doesn’t work well with the Samsung smart tv. It’s the tv itself because it works fine on my Visio tv.  I don’t have Alexa so I can’t comment on how it works.,5

Merrill,Remote works great...and then it doesn't.,"Bought the 4K Firestick, got it set up, and it worked great. About six hours later, it quit working. Dark screen. Brought the Firestick in from our bedroom, worked fine. Took the new Firestick and plugged it into the bedroom, nothing. Resets didn't work, replaced batteries, still nothing. So got a replacement Firestick and Remote. All has been good. Until today, 2 months 2 days later. Watching TV, and went to fast forward thru a commercial, nothing happens. Can't change channel, can't change volume, can't turn off the TV. Nothing. Brought in Firestick from bedroom again, works great. Took other Firestick and remote into the bedroom, nothing. So not have to order a new remote. I guess the ""better prices"" nowadays mean we get items that don't work as well? I'd rather pay more and get something that lasts more than three months.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Pretty good,Steam quality is great,5
Amazon Customer,works good,good job,5
Anne McDowell,Beyond Expectations,"I haven’t had a product that blew me out of the water in a long time. I got the 4K version and man let me tell you, this thing is amazing. The setup was so easy and worked seamlessly. They had extra dongles and wires to ensure everything fits. It remembers your prime info and saves you so much time setting up.Parental controls are built in super well and super quick to set up too. It lets you use profiles before you get into the actual streaming which is great when we don’t want our kids even to have access to Netflix or Hulu.The streaming integrations are great as well, gives you way more options than just selecting streaming apps. The Spotify integration is AMAZING.By far the BEST part is the fact that it set up volume with a sound bar about as seamless as possible and it can turn on and off your tv! This $35 item is a universal streaming machine and it doesn’t even need a sensor to work! Definitely my favorite Amazon product to this day. Great work guys, pretty much thought of everything and executed it so well!",5

Alley J,Very unreliable.,"I bought the first generation of Fire TV years ago, and loved it. I bought the second generation when it came out and immediately had reliability issues, including frequent random crashes. After that I switched to Roku and found it far more reliable, and with less annoying advertising on the screen to deal with.But recently I wanted to try the feature where a Fire TV can use an echo speaker/subwoofer pair as a home theatre, for use in my living room. So I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K to try it. This was my experience:- The main screen is extremely busy, with giant advertisements for sporting events I have zero interest in taking up the entire screen. I have to scroll down several times to get to the streaming apps I use. 1/5 for main screen design and user experience.- Once set up the video streaming was good, and high quality. 5/5 for streaming quality.- When setting up the echo home theatre it did not register my speaker/subwoofer pair as an available option. It was listen but greyed out. I tried multiple times that day and it was always greyed out, with no explanation why. I tried again the next day and it was magically available, so I connected it. 1/5 for making the process so unreliable.- Once connected the audio quality was very good, and I put on something to watch. 5/5 for audio quality once connected.- Roughly once every hour the audio would be replaced by either silence or static for about 5 seconds before reconnecting. So this home theatre option appears to be very unreliable. 1/5 for home theatre reliability.- The remote/Fire TV frequently has an odd lag, where I'll push a button and it'll take about 1 second before the screen responds. I don't know if this is an issue with the remote or the Fire TV. It make for an annoying experience. Additionally, when I press the power button to turn the tv off, about half the time it'll turn back on a second later - as if it sent 2 power button presses to the Fire TV. BTW I'm only sitting about 12 feet from the TV with no obstructions at all. 1/5 for remote reliability and user experience.After 2 days of annoyance and frustration I'm switching back to the Roku, which works reliably, and giving up on Fire TVs permanently. The first gen was great, the ones since then have been unreliable. In fact in my experience most Amazon devices have been very unreliable - Fire TVs, Fire tablets, Echos. I think I'm done with Amazon's poorly made devices.Overall 2/5 stars total for the great streaming quality, but everything else is awful and makes it almost unusable.",4

Merrill,I mean…. It’s a fire stick.,If you need a review of a fire stick you’re either born in the in or before the 1960’s or just came out of a coma. It’s plug and play. It’s super easy and turns your old TV into a smart tv basically. What more do you need to know? Do you have prime video on your tv? No? Do you want it on your tv? Then buy this. If you still pay for cable this probably won’t be for you,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Remote stopped working - 2 months works again?,"Same problem my Apple TV, remote control head. It just stops working. Won’t be detected anymore. I did the whole push this button that button, reset, this reset that, check the batteries… Doesn’t work.  The workaround of courses load the app into your phone, but still. The company as riches Amazon should have only the best materials for a product they put their name on.  The Google Chromecast is the obvious competitor. Roku lacks a feature that these other two have. I guess on a lower note, the way you plug. The thing into the side of a projector is not thought through; because you basically have this Amazon fire stick, just sticking out the side. Which looks weird. If they had a plug that was flat along the edge of the projector, that would be much better. Meanwhile, the remote control doesn’t work and that’s a nuisance.OK n now, 2 month later, the remote works again…?Unfortunately, I didn’t notice what happened that made it possible to again pair the remote…",5

Merrill,Works Great!,"My husband and I finally got the courage to “cut the cord,” switching to 100% streaming apps, and canceled all cable services (except internet) since the cost for cable had steadily increased by nearly $100 per month over the past two years. We finally had enough of the cable company’s greed and lack of appreciation and respect for their long-standing, loyal customers by refusing to offer specials for discounted services, as they do to lure unsuspecting new customers. Unfortunately, one of our perfectly good smart TVs does not support our primary streaming app and a couple others that we use regularly, so we bought the Firestick to be able stream those apps as well. It works great! We are able to access all of the popular apps used for streaming our television programs without any problems at all. We are very pleased with our purchase.",5

MoKad,Solved all of my 1st World problems,"A few years ago my friend gave me his Google Chromecast because he upgraded to a fire stick. For years it worked fine for streaming from my phone to my TV. I don't know what got updated/outdated but in the last year 1 streaming service at a time stopped being able to stream to my TV using the Chromecast.I decided to chunk it and get this firestick and have not been disappointed. It even pairs with my soundbar so the firestick remote works the soundbar volume.I was immediately able to install every streaming service I have onto the stick for free, sign in and stay signed in. No longer need my phone to stream to the tv. With the Chromecast it was always a pain to add other people to it, roommates, girlfriend etc. Now anyone can turn on my TV and binge. Even has free streaming apps included. Should have bought this years ago.",5

Wingedglo,works better than the last 3 - buffers alot,"Movers lost one of my previous ones.  I purchased an Amazon 2 item special in 2018 and initially they worked well and then started failing to connect to Amazon Home network, which they must do first before they can function (guess all they show you is in the cloud).  I wrote poor reviews on them, Amazon service was horrible, proved with a portable Roku (which I really don't like) that the internet service and TVs were not the problem.This device has very little connectivity issues and the Alexa voice on the remote works as well as before.  I do like the voice and side app loading capability of the FireStick - think it's really the best device out there - if it works correctly.I have noticed in the last 30 days quite a bit of 'orange circle' streaming buffering.  I've tested the TV again and also compared to a Roku TV on the same network, the network down is 526 mb (promised 500 with ATT) and the Amazon Firestick is the only device with buffering issues.  Other than that, it updates automatically and regularly as promised, and worked great for many months until recently.Thinking as mentioned on a Bluetooth adapter review, that the way a Firestick works is to 'phone home' and connect up with the Amazon Cloud Firestick Home network before it does anything, I suspect that Amazon Web Service is having on-going issues and that's the cause of the buffering issue.  Nothing else on my network has a buffering issue.",5

Al Dotson,Neat sound. Second-to-none image quality,"I bought this for my folks. They wanted to watch Amazon Prime programming in their living room. After configuring the Firestick in my room and test it for a while, I must say that I had second thoughts about giving this device for their usage. I currently stream Amazon Prime programming on my TCL Android TV and the sound and image quality of the Firestick provides a much better experience by far. This is a tiny but powerful device.",5

Amazon Customer,Grandma Has Been Enlightened,"I didn’t believe there could be any other good streaming device besides Apple TV, UNTIL I installed a Fire-stick. I’ve had this fire stick since a Black Friday about three years ago. I think they ran it on special for $10-$20. When it came I stuck it the bedroom entertainment center, planning to install it SOMETIME. Well even good things can die. My Apple TV did. 💔 well to buy new ones I think they are well over $100, so I said hmph! I’ll try the Stick. Wow, I had unboxed, read the directions, I had it plugged in and running in a half an hour. And I’m a non-tech savvy 77 year old! I immediately ordered another stick for the family room TV. I am a believer! Oh yeah, I ordered the new one last night, and it just delivered! Gotta love Amazon Prime.",3

Mark R. Wietstock,Amazing speed and video quality,Ok I owned firesticks 3 of them. I hated them I'd sit and watch the loading circle 5 times during a movie or TV show. Fast forward to today and WOW Absolutely amazing. No more loading symbol or waiting for an app to open. Amazon got the processor figuired out on this finally. I'll be buying more in the future.,5
Anonymous,Easy,"Easy to integrate.  I am so unhappy but the price dropped $10 the day after I received it.  I should have waited, waited, waited.  It was on Deal for the Day so I believed that would be the best price.  I was wrong. Otherwise I would have given it a total of 5 stars.",4

ip,An awesome little stick,"I got this fire stick for my brother because the tv in our living room is pretty old and doesn’t have all the apps available to download and stream. So, I remembered an alternative for that which is the Firestick that Amazon offers. I bought the device, set it up and downloaded all the streaming services that the old Samsung tv couldn’t offer. I highly recommend it to anyone with an older tv that can’t download streaming services onto the tv itself. Do update the devices before using it! Thanks Amazon!",3

Now at nearly every hotel in the world, I can having my streaming services and streaming TV.  Do not undervalue this, especially when traveling to countries that do not speak your native language.  Although I do not travel to watch TV, it is nice to hear one's native language for a tiny bit and keep up on news and even a ""fall asleep"" show or 2.  Toss in keeping up with sports and it is a few dollars well spent.  This purchase was for a guest room with a little used TV that had gotten so old that the built in apps were no longer upgradable.  Since we never use it, the TV itself is fine to display a Firestick.",3
Merrill,Great Product!,"Great Product, the new remote will help navigate to Netflix, disney plus and hulu faster. The Alexa voice integration might need to improve a little bit.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Just what we needed!,"This is our 3rd firestick purchased. One is in my room and we had one in the Living room that never really worked properly and it finally got to the point where I decided to replace it. This one is an upgrade to what we had and it works pretty flawlessly so far. The only problem I have sometimes is when I go to turn it from regular TV to the firestick, sometimes it's frozen and I have to go unplug and plug it back in. This has only happened a few times in the few months I've had this one. Which isn't a huge deal. I just hope it doesn't start doing it daily like the old one did, because that would be a deal breaker.  The Alexa feature is great and gets lots of use! I'd def buy again as long as it holds up!",5

Mary L. Hanson,Like a Black Hole,"Purchased a Fire TV Stick 4K so I could get rid of the cable box and remote my service provider was charging me for every month.  The good news is, the Fire Stick will pay for itself within 5 months.  :)  It was easy to install and, for the most part, is easy to use.  But NOT as easy as my remote was.  Also, the biggest gripe I have with the fire stick is that it is not backlit and I don't see one available that is.  Searching for the fire stick at night has been made easier by always putting it back in the same place - but even when you have it in your hand it's like looking for a black hole in the dark.  With it's matte black finish and without a back light, you cannot see any of the buttons to press.  I don't have (nor do I want) a night light in my room but when the TV goes dark I can't use the fire stick without turning the lights on and possibly waking my husband.  So while I love the idea of the savings I'll eventually see, I'm beginning to wonder if it's really worth it.  Debating whether or not to send it back.",4

The fire stick is so easy to use and add apps, The updated remote reminds me of a roku remote with shortcut buttons like Disney+, Prime, Netflix and Hulu. The home page is a little confusing at first since the apps button is so small, but once you get used to it, it’s fine.",5
oscar c fuentes,Love the Firestick but could use some tweaks...,"This is our second style of Firestick and we bought one for each room. I was really excited with the quick click buttons on the bottom of the remote, we do not use Hulu so that button is never used. We have had the new 4K stick since it came out and I am a little disappointed. We run out of storage, all the time. I hoped this new stick would have a LOT more storage but it didn't. I have no idea where all the storage goes! The buttons are a year or so old and are almost rubbed off. The last remote is in the same condition and I have had it over 5 years.",5

barbara brown,Remote Quality is Terrible,"I've had a fire stick for a while (pre-volume buttons on the remote) and I've been upgrading my house to the newer fire sticks. Not sure how these new remotes that come with the newer fire sticks are passing QC. The battery case doesn't fit the remote and is loose. I thought my first fire stick remote was just a fluke, but then I bought two more for my other TV's and all of them have the same issue with the remotes. The old fire sticks (pre-volume buttons) had a snug battery cover, but buying a silcone sleeve shouldn't have to be the solution for an out of the box remote.",5
Amazon Customer,a great solution to built in Fire TV,"I bought a 40"" Toshiba TV with built-in Fire TV about a year and a half ago. The response of the remote is terrible. I tried to review it on Amazon to warn others but the page wouldn't let me. I have 5 TVs at home and that was the most used (dining room) but the worst functioning. As I was contemplating what to buy this Prime day, I was considering replacing the Toshiba entirely. Then it occurred to me there must be an extra HDMI outlet for a regular fire stick. So I ordered another fire TV stick at the Prime day offer, and it worked. I do have to take one extra step each time I turn on the TV by switching to the HDMI outlet because I can use the new Fire TV stick/remote. So all is well with this new setup. For under $30, I can enjoy watching TV in my dining room again.",5

Merrill,"Faster, yes? But does that mean better?thaMax""","Most powerful Firestick to date with a faster processor & WiFi6 support. Candidly speaking, although a few strides have been made, the UI can still be quite cumbersome, Alexa's search function can be downright useless at times, & the sponsored ads/previews taking up most of the real estate on the homepage is a definite annoyance. That said, if you've already got a foot or two in the Amazon ecosystem, you may as well jump on in. Should you choose to use them, Alexa's integrations  do allow you to control smart home functions from the comfort of your couch/bed via your remote. Overall, the Max checks all of the boxes & then some, presuming you can get past the quirks/shortcomings above, & is a great buy.",4

Carlos Manuel Collado Vargas,Exceptional service,Came exactly like stated. Box was not damaged and product was perfect. I have use cromecast and Roku before and over time has to replace devices. But this is my 2nd fire stick to replace the Roku on my 2nd tv. First one I’ve had for years and is still going strong. Amazon fire has the best quality above the other services. Connection is a whole lot stronger and more realiable then Roku depending on what kind of Wi-Fi you use as some types of Wi-Fi devices Roku has trouble connecting to. Fire stick Has no issues at all,5
Merrill,Extremely simple to install and setup.,I truly appreciate the simplicity of this device and all of the features available with it.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,So happy with fire stick 4k,"I started my streaming experience with a smart tv, what a huge disappointment. I was almost ready to give up but decided to try the fire stick 4k. I am so pleased with the performance, I have nothing negative to say.",4
Sweetycakes,"Not the best experience for me, but i wanted the upgrade.","I upgraded to this from the 2nd Gen firestick. It works fine and im happy with it, especially the shortcut buttons on the remote to apps like Netflix, prime video, hulu ect. I was able to remap them to my liking. I am very disappointed with the feel and quality of the new remote compared to the 2nd gen one. It feels like cheap plastic and some of the buttons don't feel as durable. I noticed a common complaint that these firesticks are not 8GB as advertised, but about 5GB instead. Overall, i'm happy with it's performance, although from time to time I do experience ""bugs"" where ill hit the volume down button once and it'll go down twice (not a setting issue). When I press the Netflix button, it goes to the app, but switches my TV to the other HDMI channel which is annoying but I bypassed this issue by plugging the firestick into that channel.The unit was shipped in a bubble mailer so maybe thats the cause for my issues, but nothing inside the box looked damaged, and was packed nicely. I had amazon put my account on it ahead of time so it didnt take long to set up. Also, on my 2nd gen firestick, it used to be that when id have my bluetooth headphones connected, I could toggle the volume on them with the remote. On this 3rd gen unit, It doesn't allow me to adjust the volume at all, aside from the tv volume which is inconvenient and annoying.I've been using this unit for about 2 months and it still works fine, batteries are still good. Will update further should anything new develop with this unit.",4

Austin,Good product,"I'm new to Firestick and a long-time Roku user. The Firestick was easy to hook up but I did have a problem getting it to pair with the remote, but it finally did. I'm impressed with the quality of the Firestick the colors are nice and bright. The remote is super responsive and there are a ton of options and apps. It did take a bit for me to find out where all the apps are located as the interface is much different from Roku's. The Firestick was easy to add to my amazon account. Overall I'm happy and impressed with the Firestick.",5
Shirley Roosevelt,it's worth it!,"Very easy to setup and program. There is a guided setup menu. I was particularly impressed with how quickly the device synched with the av equipment for 1 button control of everything.Setup is intuitive.The voice recognition works well most of the time...I'll give it a 9 out of 10. There are numerous apps available for download.The streaming quality is fast and clear. No buffering.The remote is pretty simple if you compare the remote to a tv streamThe video library is a respectable size. this is an amazon product, so the default is to amazon Streaming content is available for the major networks.The device downloads and updates quickly.",5

Merrill,Make your old TV smart!!,I added this device to an older Samsung TV that was too old to get newer apps and it was like I had a new TV.  I added a second one to a non-smart TV and now it has all the latest apps too!  Streaming is very good and I also like the TV control feature.  I have a surround sound system and it let me set it up for the volume control and also powers my TV and audio system up and down!  I have yet to find a streaming app that I cannot download to these devices. What a bargain for under $40.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Great,No issues.,5
Chef Julian,Great streaming device - EASY to install,"Awesome streaming device, super quick & easy to install.  Provides great clear picture on a little 32"" bedroom tv.  Great for ""cutting the cord"" with cable, now streaming YouTubeTV in high-def, as well as Neflix and DisneyPlus.",5

bingo,Convenient But has some issues,"I love the convenience of having a remote rather than an app on my phone for chromecast, however there are several issues that I didn't have with chromecast. Volume. Sometimes I have to turn the volume wayyyy up and it's still difficult to hear. Connection issues. There are times it takes a long time to connect, despite using the extender. And the most frequent and most annoying issue is lip-sync error. Daily. I've tried shutting it off and try to watch again - it still is off. Extremely frustrating and annoying.",5
Lori,Just what i expected,"Love the fire stick, especially,  Alexa and the voice command, it was a good price for it.",4

H. Lingemann,How long will it last?,"The fire TV I purchased replaced one that didn't make it for 2 years before failing.  This one seems to work fine but only time will tell if it will continue.  As a precaution, I am unplugging it from the power source when not in use as having it constantly ""on"" may have shortened the life of the last one.  Hopefully this one will last more than 22 months.",5
Merrill,way much better than ROKU,"we had Roku way before streaming got popular. We actually have two ROKUs one for the DEN and one for the Living Room. Last week the ROKU in the den just quit working - it will not connect to our WIFI for some reason. I can only connect one at a time  - for the longest time we were using both Rokus simultaneously or alternately and just last week all of a sudden i can only connect one at a time - very frustrating. so i decided to give this amazon fire stick a try - it was on sale 40% off so why not. Got the stick yesterday and installed it tonight and WHOA ! it was quick and painless - and the quality of streaming, picture resolution is ""leaps-and-bounds"" way ahead of Roku. crystal clear sharp ! Thank you AMAZON !!!!  one happy customer here ;-)",4
Mark R. Wietstock,The remote only lasts 4 to 6 months!!,"I LOVE the Firestick!  But the remote is a spawn from hades.  I have had a Firestick for the last 5 years.  I have consistently purchased a new one every year, sometimes through Amazon and sometimes from Best Buy, because the remote dies and its more cost effective to just get a new device.  This LAST remote though!!  I purchased around September.  The remote died within a MONTH!  I have to put the batteries in the remote, turn on the tv and select a program, then take the batteries back out of the remote.  Want to change the volume?  Put batteries back in, change volume, take batteries out. Finished watching tv? Put batteries in, turn off tv, take batteries out.  The next day put batteries in and.... nothing.  Need new batteries!  seriously!! I am NOT happy!!",5
Ronald Radewitz,Muy buen dispositivo,Ver tv,5
jsmck,FIRE STICK,"The second fire stick I purchased. I spent hours trying to connect. remote would not link to fire stick, but I feel the product was just not working properly so I ordered just the remote it connected to my fire stick, but the volume control button would not work.  I have a fire stick and it was easy to link together ,but the remote stopped working. I will make a purchase  in the future, hopefully the one I order will link together 👍👍 well I purchased my third fire stick, and I am loving it! I attached the fire stick to the back of my television and it connected straight away as did the remote control with no problems. 3rd time is the charm. I recommend this product. Go spoil yourself and purchase one, you deserve it!! 👍🙂",5
Richard,Functional,"So this is the larger version of an echo dot, of which I've owned 3 dots. I can't say the echo isn't any better than an echo dot. Both have good sound quality most of the time, Bluetooth connectivity, easy to use, etc. however for the echoes size it doesn't sound better, just equivalent, you may notice it can sound a little more robust at times.",3

As of late numerous problems with apps crashing and consistent (several times a day disconnect and forgetting Wi-Fi password). Got the 4k fire stick, arrived within 5 hours of ordering for a great price. Setup in minutes and instantly setup controls for the tv remote which work perfectly. Device responds quickly to controller inputs and the voice search works flawlessly. Very impressed and happy with my purchase. Thanks Amazon.",5

Mark R. Wietstock,Works great even if I'm tech challenged.,"My niece set this up for me, walked me through it, and it's great.",5
Tania,ZERO buffering since upgrading to the 4K stick,"I owned the regular fire stick for years and would constantly encounter buffering/crashing/freezing issues (most notably while using Hulu). It would constantly lose connectivity despite the TV being less than 6 feet away from my router and none of my other devices using Wi-Fi were being affected or otherwise losing their signals. It would also get VERY hot after just an hour or two. Same issues would occur on a different fire stick at my parents’ house with a similar proximity to the router. No amount of problem solving, cache/data clearing, or uninstalling & reinstalling was helping, so I figured I’d order the 4K stick when it was on sale to see if a next-gen device would still have the same problems even though I don’t have a 4K tv (but I do like the Amazon interface and Home Screen layout). After two months of usage, I haven’t had a single instance of buffering on any app and not once has it lost connectivity (although it still says my signal strength is just “good” even though the router is literally right beside it). Will update if this changes, but so far, so good.",5

Mark R. Wietstock,"Was 4 stars but now it’s 3, stupid remote…","Everything about the firestick works perfectly fine. I’ve owned one before, so it nothing out of the ordinary, but the fact that the batteries didn’t last 3 months, doesn’t make sense, to me. How you selling a “new product” to someone and the batteries 🪫  are about to die? I mean, who puts old batteries in something, you’re selling? The answer is “a crook”. Someone that is trying to get over, when you could’ve just ♻️ the batteries, player, 🤦🏽‍♀️.Update: it wasn’t the batteries, it was the remote. So instead of 4 stars, you get 3, now. Nico, with Amazon customer service, had me kill more batteries, to give him the serial number. Then he caught an attitude when I called him on it. Batteries ain’t cheap, but he didn’t want to reimburse me on the now 6, batteries that this remote is killing, that before almost made it to 3 months, but now dies within a matter of a couple of hours. Either way, the crap is defective and Nico had no choice but to send out a replacement. Just wondering why he needed the serial number, if he was just gonna send… never mind, hopefully this remote isn’t refurbished, like apparently this one was. I just read some more reviews, and determined that the fix for the remote issues, is to go back to the old remotes, they worked. The reason why I don’t have my old one, is because I didn’t use it, so I sold it to a friend. But I need one now cause my LG tv won’t download DIRECTV Stream. But I wish I still had the old one, cause I never had any issues like I, and apparently everybody this year, is.",5

Mark R. Wietstock,I was so excited,"My previous fire stick would play jeopardy on its on. Meaning I’d click the button on my app once and it would scroll mindlessly. My tv and stick were both handed down to me. Stick had a remote, but even with battery changes it just stopped working. Didn’t make sense to purchase a new remote, especially with the jeopardy scroll.Looking for the best deal, this was like $8 more than the lower version. Actually picked it up at target, same day hack with no min order for the win.Here’s the thing. I though I read everything good enough, but the buttons on the remote confused me. Yea I know I get it. Clearly + & - mean what they mean. But I was SOOOOOOO HAPPY, when I put 2&2 together and realized I now have a tv remote as well!First off. One remote will always be my preference. But to think “nawwww that’s not what it is” and it to actually be it. Man I was thrilled.Now my son can completely do everything on his own again. He’s 8, but with no remotes I had to use my phone to constantly change or click continue watching. He could handle going up to the tv and turning it up. Even better, now I don’t have to jump up in the middle of the night to turn the tv down because I forgot. Or stand and wait at the tv to see if the level is too loud, go back to the bed and check to see the level.Single mom, we share a room. This has been a very pleasant game changer!Everything works great! That I’ve used lol I’m now “becoming my parents” with technology so I’m still figuring out what the new features are.",4

Gloria Spence,Great device but remote needs new design,"I have owned 4 or 5 of these over the generations, that have all been great but every remote suffers the same design flaw.

Anne,Much faster than my old fire stick,Newer model has more features and is faster than previous models,4
jason,For an upgrade.. it's worth it.,Not really much to say other than it's a solid device. I am though a bit concerned on the storage space side of things but other than that the Wi-Fi would always need improving like most things but nothing a little clearing the cache and giving it some rest from time to time won't help. Because it's very helpful actually xD.,5
Luis Carrion,Love it,I had a Google chromecast previously but I am in love with this one it is so much more intuitive and it works very fast and it really recognizes my voice Easily I really like that it will also tell you other apps and you can have all your streaming platforms in one space,3

Von Hincher,Love it,It was easy to set up and to add my Netflix and Disney +So I’m happy!I’m sure over time I will get familiar with the flow and access,5
Jim Morris,Great,Works great I like it,4
Patricia S. Humphrey,Wife wants choice in streaming,This gives you a wider world for streaming especially if you have an older TV. Easy to install and we get all sorts of shows.,5
aek,Unable to get help. May be defective,We’ve had this remote for a few month and it slowly began cutting out and freezing. I have reused the older one and works fine. I have tried it on several tvs and it does the same thing. We have tried to get in touch with support and we’re unable to reach anyone ( time of year perhaps)  the stick now cuts off a dozen times a day. I have liked the other models but since we have been unable to resolve the problem is why it is only getting 3 stars,3
ProB,4K fire stick,"What can I say that Amazon hasn’t already said? It’s a 4K fire stick it works flawlessly, the streaming quality is perfect, and it was cheap.",5

Imasiberian,Great update for an old TV,"We have a large TV that is around 5-6 years old. It is ""Smart"" but didn't have the ability to add apps and the streaming was often a bit iffy. When we moved to a new house where the only services were streamed it became virtually unuseable. We thought we would give it one last shot of new life by buying this Fire Stick and it is amazing. Now we have Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix streaming perfectly and have added Disney+ which comes with Hulu but we couldn't add before and we have also added Discovery plus. This stick is definitely worth the money so if you want to ditch cable or just revive an older TV this is the way to go. We love it and it also switches our Samsung TV on and off so we now just need one little remote. A definite winner all round.",5

Jeffrey ,For those having Remote pairing issues...Overall good product,"Like many reviews here... I had significant issues with getting the remote to pair.  It seems to be an issue with the software version on the device being mis-matched with the software on the remote with the Alexa button.I was able to work around this by pairing an existing remote I had for the Firestick with the simple Voice button on top(that also had volume control) - that remote worked almost instantly after pressing the home button for 10 seconds and I was able to complete the setup.  I was still unable to add the new remote no matter what I did (would not show up as discoverable)I then had to do a software update on the Fire stick; which then made the NEW remote discoverable but it ALSO required an update before it would finish the setup.  Once both the firestick and the new remote were updated, it all finally worked as expected.I'm unaware of a solution if you do not have an older remote to do the initial setup of the fire stick.Otherwise the performance of the device is great.  No complaints on features/functionality.",5
anthony romanelli,Simple to use.,"I like Firestick better than Roku. Others may disagree, but I find the remote control easier & quicker to use, and I think picture quality is bettr too.",5
Phil,AMAZING,"I've had the second generation and saw this on sale had too buy it, I love the way my streams look in 4k!!!",5
Amazon Customer,The 4k has more capabilities!,I replaced the older model fire stick & bought the 4k. The remote has more features & is easier since u don’t need the tv remote.,4
Mariela,A BIG solution in a tiny package,"This little addition to my TV has a big effect!  For some reason my TV doesn't connect to Netflix or Prime even though those features are supposedly on it.  But it never connects.  Solution, the Fire Stick.  Immediate connection to those ""extra"" channels with excellent picture and sound quality.  If your Smart TV is acting not too smart, this may be your solution.  It is mine.",5

Kenneth Arnold,work great,"love this i used to have the bare minimum from Comcast and kept bugging my hubby to use the fire stick.but my husband died from covid in Jan and i finally learned how much Comcast cost. our basic was $249 a month for lousy tv. i dropped everything and just got internet $80. then i bought this new fire stick and only paid once. now i have endless tv with options, and saving$169 a month,  winner in my book.with the fire stick you are not paying a monthly bill for the opportunity to order  whatever you want to watch on any app, there are hundreds of options for what ever you want to watch, like tubi  netflix and hundreds of others. you have an app library and app store , to choose from, some are free some only a small monthly subscription.i watch horror tv so i have shudder, and a few others, there are game apps, news, food, crafts and so many othersthe fire stick paid for itself after the first week and i am so glad i got it, thanks Amazon",5
Amazon Customer,Exactly What I Needed!!,"Allows me access to all of my steaming services, even Peacock. I love the Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ buttons because those are ones I use the most often. Easy to set up, such a breeze with the quick walk through instructions. Love having access to all of my shows, and also love knowing that I can use on any T.V. in the future. Perfect !!!",5

Tons of free material, not just paid services. Movies, TV series that are internet streaming and not on regular tv, sports, music, all kinds of stuff. The days of cable TV and hundreds of channels available with nothing to watch are gone!Set up was incredibly easy and took only a few minutes. I can't say much about the voice or Alexa part of it, because I don't use that. I use the remote, however, and it works very well. Intuitive and easy.",5

Merrill,So far it's working well,"After I connected it to my correct amazon account, all is good now.  Got my YouTube TV on there, my YouTube acct too, and the sorting through the channels are better than Google Fiber.  Set up easy but it's awkward with the wiring - can't explain it but the connection goes up (instead of down) so the wire is facing north (to ceiling) and puts pressure on that USB/whatever connection to the TV - so I had to tape it to the back of the TV to alleviate the pressure of the wire (hope that makes sense?).  But so far streaming looks good and controls are simple yet good.",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Good,Works fine,5

Bruce Markley,Firestick,Product works as expected and as my previous order had,4
Splash,good but remote doesn't work,I bought a fire stick and have been using it for 2 month now. The streaming in great but I have been using the remote app on my phone because the actual remote does not work. It keeps stating that the remote has low battery. I have changed the batteries several times and it still doesn't work. Alexa will also not connect due to the low batteries. I still give it 3 stars because the streaming has no hiccups when I use the remote app.,5
