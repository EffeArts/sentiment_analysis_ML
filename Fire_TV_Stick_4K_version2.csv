Merrill,"Arrived broken, after 3 hours talking to Amazon it's still not being replaced!!!","DO NOT BUY FIRE TV DEVICES!!! CHOOSE ANOTHER STREAMING PLAYER BRAND!!!Worst customer service experience in my life from Amazon!!!! Amazon sent me a completely broken Fire TV 4k stick! From day one the audio cuts out entirely after a few mins of playing a video, and does not return until stick is physically unplugged from power. Then it cuts out again. Problem occurs in all video apps, and I tried full software restore, plugging into multiple different TVs, as well as different audio connections (direct to TV through HDMI, Through receiver, through bluetooth on multiple devices.) And my other Fire TV 4k of the same model works fine in this same TV, so... THE STICK IS BROKEN! So I contact Amazon through their chat interface and Parmish is a total disaster at helping me. I tell him that I have done a full software restore on it, at which point he responds that I need to do a full software restore. Ya know, the thing I just told him that I did already. Then I tell him I have already tried plugging the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver, and he says ""well than what I need you to do is plug the fire TV directly into the TV with no sound receiver."" This happened over and over. It was like a bad joke. But I wasn't laughing. Finally after about an hour of this nonsense he decides that my Fire TV stick needs to be replaced. Then he says I ""Have no card on file"", what ever that means. So after about 10 more unanswered and ignored questions to him about just what he's talking about I finally figure out he means my Amazon account has no credit card on file. But it does have a card on file. I log in and verify this. The card is up to date and working, and amazon had just charged it that day even. So I tell him this, and he responds that I need a credit card on file in order to send out a replacement, even though it won't be charged. I tell him again that the card is on file and working, and he says it need to be updated. Even though it does not. So I hit ""edit"" on my card info on file, and resubmit the same working card. Parmish sees this on his end and says thank you. Then he says I need to update my OTHER CARD on file. I look and there is an old credit card from 6 years ago on the account from a bank I no longer use, and its not even selected as the active/favored card, so It doesn't even matter that it there, but I delete it anyways just to be sure. Then Parmish says I need to reenter and update that old card (that I no longer bank with) in order to get a replacement sent out. At this point I'm done with Parmish. The whole conversation was absolutely ridiculous! I say ""thank you for the help but I need a supervisor. Please transfer me to a supervisor.""So Parmish transfers me to Vikas. I ask Vikas if he is a supervisor and he says ""no."" (Are you surprised by this? I wasn't.) So I explain that I was suppose to be transferred to a supervisor and ask that Vikas transfer me directly to a supervisor. And I'm transferred to Annal.I ask Annal if they are a supervisor, and they answer... get ready for it... are you ready... they answer ...""No"" !!!!!!!!! They &^^&%&$^^%^ answer ""No.""So I close the chat window I just wasted over an hour on and I call Amazon. This is where the real nightmare begins. I start off with a regular customer service rep and I ask her to transfer me to a supervisor right away because this will be my 4th attempt to get a supervisor. She is very polite and gets me a supervisor on the line write away. I explain the entire issue with the Fire Tv 4k Stick and everything I have done to troubleshoot it already YET AGIAN, and the supervisor apologizes for all the insane trouble I've been having. She sounds like she really wants to help me, asked some more questions, and then tells me that she can't replace this particular model because its out of stock. I had just checked the stock, so I knew it wasn't out. I checked it again, and then told her it appears to have plenty of stock. She verified what model it was again, then said ""oh yes, I guess we do have it, let my put you on hold while I try to send you one."" She comes back a while later and says ""the system won't let me send you one. I have to transfer you to a Fire TV Specialist, buy I'll get you a manager there as well.So then I have to go through the whole thing again with this new Fire TV Specialist person. She keeps putting me on hold to check things over and over again. And she has me do crazy things - For example, she insists I go to my TV, unplug the other working Fire TV I now have in there, and plug this broken one back in, then load it up and read the serial number off of it to her from the info screen. Why? Doesn't she already have that info? She should. And WHY AM I PLUGGING A $25 DEFECTIVE BROKEN DEVICE BACK INTO MY $2,000 FLATSCREEN??!!! I don't want to do that. I shouldn't be asked to do that. What the hell? Then she keeps checking to see if I'm still in warranty. REALL???!!! I JUST got this stick in the mail. I JUST GOT IT. How long is the warranty period that she has to keep checking on.. 5 hours after purchase. Also, this is a brand new model that just came out. HOW COULD ANY OF THEM POSSIBLY BE OUT OF WARRANTY??!!Finally after 3 HOURS of talking to people about this and a final, particularly long hold while the Fire TV Specialist person tries to figure out if I can be sent a replacement - I give up. I tell her I'll just return it instead - just so I can just get off the phone. But I'm NOT returning it - That too would probably turn into another huge nightmare. It's not worth my $25 for all this aggravation. So... I'M DONE. This is ridiculous! After speaking with a total of SIX people for over THREE HOURS.. My brand new Fire TV 4K stick in now in my trash can and I'm never buying a Fire TV product again. All Amazon need to do was have me send in my broken one and then send out a replacement. That's It. They could have sorted out all their serial numbers and insane data requirements after they got my stick back. AS a customer, I simply got something in the mail that arrived broken and I wanted it replaced soon after I got it. How simple of a transition is that? But instead I got this torrent of poor customer service and bizarre data mining. SO.. Officially.. I'm no longer a Fire TV user.I'm currently switching my entire smart TV ecosystem for the entire house over to Google's Android TV now, I've had it with Fire TV, and I suggest you do the same. Android TV systems don't suffer from the same app limitations that Amazon does (IE with Fire TV you get access got about 12% of the Android apps available to the rest of the Android TV world, Even though Fire TV runs on Android, and you can install what ever apps you want on your Android TV device without having to TRICK IT into installing it), it still works and runs apps (like playing a game or looking at photos) even if your internet connection goes down (Fire TV becomes a useless brick without constant internet), and the whole thing just seems to run better. I don't have time to deal with Amazon's nightmare anymore. All I needed was for Amazon to replace the broken Fire TV stick they JUST sent me, and they can't even do that. So, ummmm... BYEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Unreliable. Multiple connection drops every day,"We purchased a 4K Ultra HD Fire Stick as a replacement for a Fire Box that we had for the last 4 years.  The old Fire Box worked well and was reliable except for a needed occasional reboot every month or so.  This new Fire Stick is anything but reliable.When the Fire Stick works, we do not have any complaints.  However, what constitutes this one-star review is the Fire Stick’s propensity to stop streaming (as indicated by the rolling circle on the screen) due to loss of internet connection.  Most days this occurs multiple times. (As an aside Wifi connection is not lost at this time.)  Last night was the worst, four loss of connections during a two hour movie.This loss of connection is specific to the Fire Stick.  When the Fire Stick has a connection loss with the internet, our tablets, desktop, as well as Alexa unit (no less than a foot from the Fire Stick) all stay connected to the internet and work properly, so not an ISP issue.  I have switched the Fire Stick to various HDMI ports on the TV and use the HDMI extender cable and the loss of connection issue continues to occur.  This a Fire Stick specific issue.We contacted Customer Service and working with them was taxing.  The first call was disconnected in the middle of the call without an resolution.  Upon calling back and restating the issues, the second rep said the issue was due to the ISP (which couldn’t be the case since our other devices were connected and working properly when the Fire Stick lost connection) and/or reboot the stick each time the problem happened (rebooting the Fire Stick multiple times in one night is an unacceptable suggestion).  I’ve asked for a replacement, but if the same issues occur, it’ll be time to investigate another streaming device.I do not know if this issue is caused by the need to place the stick behind the TV and/or a software or hardware issue, but we are very disappointed in lack of reliable quality of the new Fire Stick.  Hopefully the placement stick will work.An update:  Customer Service told me to have faith that downloading the latest updates would solve my problem.  Updates were downloaded and the problem was not fixed.  The Fire Stick still has connectivity issues. The Fire Stick has some defect.",5
alternative Travel Press,Annoying if you don’t want/have kids+,"I bought this to limit the time my kids spend on the tv. We bought them fire tablets 2 summers ago and it came with the year of “freetime” (what kids+ used to be called) and I kinda liked it kinda didn’t, that would be a review for the tablet though. Anyway, we decided not to keep it when the year was up and their tablets currently just have games/movies that I’ve bought and added manually. None of the kids+ stuff shows up. Obviously, right, since I don’t pay for it. However, on the tv, it clogs up the whole tv with locked kids+ content. My kids have to scroll through like 8 rows of locked categories before getting to the “added for you” row. What the heck! I contacted customer service and they said to deregister it and then register it again. That worked for a few minutes but the next time I went back to the kids profile it was all back again. I’ve only had the thing for like a week but if I can’t get this stuff to go away I think I’ll have to return it and seek a refund for the games I just bought since they can’t even find them lost in all the locked content.The stick itself stream quality is just fine, we have a Roku tv though and it’s probably the same so we don’t need it. Just bought for the kids features. Alexa so far hasn’t done anything I’ve asked, doesn’t really understand things as well as Siri, and doesn’t work in kids profile (might be a setting to change that though) so eh as far as she goes.",3
Kindle Customer,Not compatible with Toshiba Fire TV on the same network.,"I bought a fire stick 4k and a 4k max to replace 2 chromecasts with the intention of being able to tell Alexa to power on and off one of the existing TV instead of having a routine for Alexa to tell google assistant to turn off the TV.I already have a Toshiba Fire TV with Alexa built in working perfectly (before these showed up).  If I link a second fire device (4k/4kmax), I am only be able to pause playback using the linked echo device on any of the fire devices. If I use the Alexa button on the remote I have full Alexa functionality, but none of my echo devices will function correctly after adding either fire stick to the app. I tried researching fixes and tried everything I could think of to make it work before calling tech support.Tech support told me to try a couple fixes that I had already tried before calling with no success. I was transferred 3 times  and finally they just told me to return them. After sending the return information via email, I left with a connected call and no responses or music from the support side. I waited a few minutes for a response before giving up and hanging up. Tech support seems to have limited knowledge concerning the devices they support. I used the online support tool before calling, and calling just resulted in them basically reading the online support site to me.I was going to purchase another TV with the Fire TV built in, but now I doubt I will because I dont want to have to return it because it breaks the system.The amount of money involved is nothing to them, but I will probably never buy or reccomend another Alexa product based on this experience.",1
Amazon Customer,COMPLET LOSS OF  RESPECT FOR AMAZON!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered three fire sticks and two of them are fine but the third does not have the same functions as the first two that allow me to download unknown apps. I need this function on all three and AMAZON CS told me that there was nothing she could do for me fix it. She did let me know that she would send my complaint over and i could expect to hear from Amazon in 2 or 3 days!!! Meanwhile she can't hear half of what I'm asking because her dog is barking in the background. She also could not help me at all navigate the settings she tried to walk me though. So, know i have a streaming service i can only use on two of the three tv sets. I guess Amazon thinks I will just need to purchase another service as well if I want to use their equipment??????? This is something that could have been resolved in two min, but I was on the phone for an hour and got the run around. I asked to talk to someone else and was told I would need to hang up and reach out to another number!!! I guess another hour of my time is no big deal to them.",1
Sidewinder623,When is AMAZON going to answer my problem as they promised they would.,"I purchased two Fire Sticks, one works perfectly.  The second one will not allow me to log onto the Apple TV app.  I have spoken with two Amazon Reps in Customer service and one told me it wasApples Fault, the second one said that someone would get back with me.  I also been on chatt with another and they said that to call Apple.  I told them that I did and Apple's Engineers got back with me after checking it out and said that it was Amazon's fault.  I offered to exhange the Fire Stick with the Rep.  He told me that He will work on it and would get back with me.  After three days NOTHING.  You customer Service is terrible.  When APPLE said that would get back with me at 12:00 noon eastern time today, they did just that.  I am going to wait till the exchange date expires for you to do something.  I have been more than reasonabale by offering to send you my fire stick for a new one.  PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.",1
Jeff Fox,These things are HORRIBLE,"We have replaced several of these for the same issue. It just recently started happening to us, though. The audio and video will not sync up properly. So we hear something, but it is not in time with the video. So we either hear their voice and then the mouth moves, or the mouth moves and then we hear the voice. We have tried to sync them manually following instructions given by the support team and what we found online. It isn't perfect, but it is better. After a little while, it is VERY noticeable again. It is not limited to one application, either. We have seen it happen on Prime Video and YouTube TV. I have not had these issues using our Smart TVs. Since it works fine on Smart TVs, and since it is not just one application, the FireStick TV Stick 4k is the last remaining culprit.When we used Hulu+, it would just kick us out or lag forever. Did not have as many issues with that when I used either a Smart TV or my PS4. Just a horrible product. I am going to try to get Rokus for my other TVs and see if that helps at all.I did not use Alexa or voice commands very often, so I do not have a large sample size, but it seems to work fairly well for those types of functions.",1
Douglas E. Koliboski,FireTV stick 4K was delivered defective and Amazons response was 15% off next one I buy,"FireTV stick 4K was delivered defective and never worked, no registration information or applications were ever downloaded, a 3 second fire tv logo is the only thing it would do... I tried searching online for a possible quick fix but the only option left was calling Amazons tech support and after an hour on the phone, nothing worked...unplug, wait10 minutes, plug back up, restart....change out adapter...change batteries...factory reset...etc... After being put on hold for another long period as he spoke to his supervisor, his response was that I needed to purchase another Firestick 4K with a 15% ...I thought this situation would have been made right by offering to send me a replacement Firestick 4K and a return postage box for the defective product...that way Amazons Quality Control could inspect and verify that  it wouldn't boot up beyond the initial firetv logo...I guess it's just more convenient for them to resort to ""plausible deniability"" on their end and ignore my petty grievances as just someone trying to scam them for free merchandise or that through my own my error that made it defective. I've had 6 Firesticks over the past few years, mostly because of the generation upgrades and never have I  experienced an issue like this... I've spent a great deal of time researching online for a solution...a great deal of time waiting on hold to speak to an Amazon representative...where I have to speak slow and simple English because it's to a foreign call center....constantly having to ask the technician to repeat because of accent or the limited basic vocabulary, especially having to translate technical terms all while  being put on hold for lengthy periods of time made it extremely challenging...if not for optimistic hopes of possibly solving this problem soon then my patience would have gotten the best of me...Amazon failed in it's responsibility of ensuring quality service and product.  I can assure you, my time invested in trying to make this right would equal 4 times the value in price I paid expecting a fully functioning Firestick 4K...and what aggravates me the most is that Amazon shows no effort in providing good customer service or responsibility in the quality of their products....Is it my integrity being questioned by some gaslighting Amazon employee over a 35 dollar transaction they failed to honor? dayKeep th' change, my integrity ain't for sale.Good day to you",1
Kelly Gressman,Used/damaged ?,I have a fire stick lite that I use a lot but I wanted something with a little more punch and I saw the 4k stick was on sale for half off so I jumped on it and bought it. Then I received it and the box looked like it was opened and or damaged. I connected the stick to my tv to start the set up process and that’s when I noticed how slow it was going. It felt like there was a delay in the input. So I changed the batteries hoping that was the fix but it wasn’t. When I went to make sure it has the latest update I had to literally update it 6 times. Then I noticed that a few features were missing and so I went back to see if I had another update and sure enough I ended up updating 2 more times but the features were still missing. So I downloaded my first app and it took about 5 min to download and that’s when I got fed up and just threw it in the trash.,1
Patrick Rice,Causes interference on the HDMI Bus,"I purchased this 4K Fire TV device along with an Ethernet adapter, since I have a network switch under my TV that has a direct connection to my router. This way I don't have the rely on wifi for HD reception. I hooked every up and it all seemed to be working fine on one of my spare HDMI ports on my Sony TV. As the days went by I started noticing that watching various movies from my Home screen, on Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, that I would get audio drop outs on my Sonos Beam Soundbar. When this would happen, I would back up the movie to see if the problem was with the movie, but it never was. It was getting so bad, that I also lost my surround speakers and they would come and go intermitently. I contacted Sonos, who has a very good support staff. After a couple of calls and sending them diagnostic codes, they told me that there was noise on the HDMI Bus and asked what other devices were plugged in. The only two devices were my Sony Blu-Ray player and the newly introduced Fire TV. Since I have the Blu-Ray player plugged in for over two years, I removed the Fire TV.  Right away, I notice a difference.  My surrounds came back and worked well, and as the evenings went by, I noticed that I stopped getting the audio drop outs. Actually, the Fire TV is only a platform to load and install apps that you have to pay for anyway. It's like my old Roku box which I removed a while back when Sony told me that I would need a CEC-less adapter for Roku.  So, now it's less than one month and I don't know what to do. I placed everything back in their original boxes and may give Amazon a call tomorrow. Otherwise, I may just hold on to the two devices and see if anyone else wants them.",1
steven pagan,Not user friendly,"First off, delivery was quick and the driver was friendly and that is about all I can say that I enjoyed of this so far.  The Firestick doesn't seem to want me to stream movies in full screen.  I have a QLED TV and now I lost part of my screen with the firestick.  Previews will be full screen but once you hit play, not full screen anymore.  Don't have this problem with a Roku which is what I was replacing to get an upgrade I thought.  Can't log into AMC+ with your existing account, it will make you setup a new account and pay double the money.  I already paid for a year and will use my existing one.  Amazon seems to be acting like Apple and want to control the apps and where you spend the money.  My next move is to return this and get the latest Roku 4k stick.  I have tried all the online fixes that were suggested and problems have persisted.",1
John G,Wouldn’t buy if I’d known.,"This has the potential to have 5 stars with no problem.  It’s easy to connect, the operating system is fantastic. It literally has everything.  Except streaming.  It lags and skips constantly.  I figured I downloaded too many apps.  So, I uninstall everything but the mains. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon prime, HBO max…. I also clear the cache on everything and restart before I watch the fire stick.  Nothing changes.  Lags and skips constantly.  It ruins everything I try to watch.  It’s not worth it. I wouldn’t buy it.  Terrible streaming.  It’s like every few seconds the picture is in slow motion and skips around.  TERRIBLE!!!!!  Total waste of money.  This thing doesn’t have enough memory to actually operate.Update: I’mpurchasing the Fire tv 4K MAX. It’s supposed have better RAM and internals.  We will see.",1
Merrill,What an Absolute POS,"The Amazon Firestick 4K is....in a word....CRAP. In essence, You have to pay through the nose if you want to watch anything decent.The ""Live"" news is not new and isn't current.Free movies: You can watch Sausage Party and any other imaginable piece of crap movie both new and movies that are 30 years old that youve never heard of before. Don't  expect to find a John Hughes movie without having to pay for it.Monday night, Sunday Football....nope! You can watch a game from 20 years ago....Maybe you'll find a free Marx Brothers movie.I'd say about 95% of the free content on Firestick, you've never heard of and if you have, it's crap.You can't watch Caddyshack for free or any other classics. If you want a decent array of recent movies, you'll have to purchase subscription for a dozen different links (whatever ghey're called) which will cost you a couple of hundred bucks a month.Keep your cable for $150.00/month (or $175./$200.) and watch basically whatever  you want all in one place.Firestick SUCKS!",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Came Out The Box Not Working,What I dislike the most the firestick that's being replaced is barely 1.5 years old. Was told by customer care they no longer support the software for the device I had to upgrade to the 4K HDR. Advised them that was a 4K HDR they claim they no longer support. Them: of well you need to upgrade to 4K Max. Spoke to supervisor same crap. Was advised not to trade in through their trade in program because I would only receive $4.00. WTH....oh but we will give you 15% off towards a new purchase. Ok I fell for it. Received the device yesterday plugged in started the install process. Once I was connected to the Wi-Fi I it started a software update. Then I received an error message stating the update failed to unplugged for a fews seconds and try again. Well this went on after 5 tries disconnecting everything piece by piece. Same thing. Called have to get a replacement. Moral to the story is why are you you no longer supporting a device you created barely 2 years ago just to force an upgrade on junk you threw together just to make a quick buck. Save your money everything is a hustle now. I'll press my luck with a Roku device. Apple and Amazon play to much. Wish me luck!,1
Darrian Turner,3rd Generation doesn't work for Apple TV app,"I have multiple Fire TV Stick devices that work just fine with the Apple TV app. However, the 3rd generation Fire TV Stick 4K is worthless if you plan on using Apple TV. Apple TV login fails verification FOREVER. When you see the screen to sign in with your account no QR code is displayed so you are required to 'Use Remote' and enter your Apple ID. But when you enter your Apple ID it always fails to verify login info. Tried every trick I could find, deleted Apple TV and reinstalled, reset Fire Stick to factory default , etc. NOTHING works!",4
Slokom,CHEAP - broke in two months.,"Bought two of these in July 2022. One device works okay- slow loading. The other stopped working properly by the end of September, after very light use. The unit doesn't turn on- needs to be unplugged/re-plugged  every time. The remote SUCKS down batteries, even when TV is off. Batteries need to be removed from the remote after every use, or they will be dead by the next day. As such, the device is unusable, but not until I was past my return date. I was hopeful this new line would work better than previous models with similar problems, but nope still cheaply made. After this I will not purchase another Amazon streaming device.",5
Gregory Wilkinson,"Brick, Brick, Brick!!!!!!","I have bought about 15 firesticks over the years and have about 5 bricks. I understand over time the old ones are gonna go bad but I bought this one 2 months ago and its already dead. I am more frustrated because it how I watch my football games at work and ITS GAMEDAY!! Very frustrated at this moment. I am not a programmer but I am at least somewhat technically inclined. Plugged into outlet not TV, checked HDMI input, tried different TVs and different outlets. It worked on that TV this morning then BLANK SCREEN. Very frustrated",3
Honeybee,So Many Problems! I Won’t Ever Buy Another One!,"I have been using a FireStick for several years now. At first they were not too bad, however recently I’ve had to keep purchasing new ones because they keep having issues with freezing up, crashing, restarting, completely shutting off, apps not working, connection issues, etc.The last one I bought we set it up and within the first 3 minutes it automatically shut off. We unplugged everything and tried again. It did the same thing. We tried it on a different TV and it continued to shut off. I looked up troubleshooting for the specific probables and followed the suggested instructions, it still did not work. I ended up returning it for a refund and will not purchase another one ever again.",1
Terry Kelly,How to Use this Stick and lack of written information given at time of purchase.,"This fire stick was designed without any consideration for the elderly population.  The size  is too small, the buttons are too close, the ability to turn TV on and off with one button (having to return to home to turn off.... this is not an improvement this is going backward.The fact that you need a separate stick for each  TV, etc.  can only use two sticks at a time without paying additional money...the channels full of reruns and movies which are old and played over and over...etc. etc. etc.  the costs of said sticks.......the cable company should pay for these sticks....The confusion of what is free and what is extra....the complex way of explaining how to use this stick...",1
Justin Gray,Still terrible.,"Brand new out the box, it acted up. Before I could even finish setting it up, the screen went black. I waited. Nothing. I had to unplug it and start all over. I got it set up & it had to do some updates. Cool.. I watched TV for maybe 5 minutes shut the TV off. Went downstairs to clean my garage and stuff. I come back upstairs to watch TV. I turn the device on & another update happens. It got stuck in one spot for 5 minutes before even budging. After the updates done, the screen goes black & freezes again. I had to unplug it once again to get it to restart and work. If I have to unplug this thing one more time, I’m sending it back and getting and Non Amazon device because I’ve NEVER had a fire stick work properly. Absolutely ridiculous.",1
Sonny G,Pain,So it’s an amazing device when it wants to work. Every time I go on to the fire stick I have to restart the entire system so I can see any episode on any platform. What do I mean by this is when let’s say I go on HBO or any other app it acts normal you go through every screen up until you play the video. Once the video starts to play the screen goes dark and their is no image just sound. At first I thought it was just one of the platforms but now I can say with out a doubt it does it on every single platform especially after I watch an episode then turn of the fire stick so when I come back to watch episode 2 later on I have to restart the entire fire stick so that I can watch episode 2 and if I do the same thing for episode 3 guess what got to restart the whole thing again. Until they fix this I wouldn’t recommend this product. I’ve tried restarting the whole fire stick many times and it still does it,1
Ann L.,HORRIBLE battery life,"The Amazon branded batteries in my fire stick were showing low just a couple days after receipt of the unit. I replaced with my own new batteries and now just a couple days later screen reports “low batteries - change ASAP”! I’m afraid to even open my second unit that I just ordered. Internet reports others are seeing battery life problems, but not this bad!Note: While I view this as a major problem, I must admit that we do love it - while it works!",1
Senior Citzen,Can’t use Hulu and they’ve known about the problem since 2015,Fire stick is absolute garbage!! It has a super small processing board forcing it to reset like 3 times a day. They say Hulu is comparable but it is a well known issue that it absolutely is not. Then they give you all this junk to try to “reset” acting like you have too much data on it (I have like 3 apps) but in reality it’s the 30 apps the fire stick won’t let you use. Look up the Amazon forums on how long the Hulu issue has been going on and it speaks for itself. I’m returning this tomorrow.,1
BreadWinner Daniel,"terrible remote, to many clicks","it takes way to many clicks to get to places. The remote is to small and needs a different shape so you can tell by feel if it in your hand the right way so you don't press buttons only to see you lost your movie. I liked the old cable way of just click the stations, the up ot down, Turn it on and there were your stations. To be honest I wish I had cable back,. Then I don't want to see things like LGBT channels in the open, you are close to running an adult service. Posting warnings will not stop teenagers from looking around. You need to have an option to remove the entire LGBT listings from the front screen.  we have considered canceling the entire Amazon Fire Stick. I know elderly people that have been forced on this because they are doing away with cable box access and they are totally lost, several have been forced to buy new TV's etc. Cable was best it just was the FCC and congress that failed to limit all the ads, the shopping channels were every where. You had a 30 min show that became an hour due to commercials. Soo Amazon will become the same.",1
Merrill,Failed in less than six months,"This is our second fire stick, since we have two televisions. It's an easy setup and there's a lot of options and features to go with the fire stick. We didn't hesitate to get a second one for our other television based on our previous experience with the first fire stick.UPDATE: The Firestick stopped working in October 2022. We purchased a warranty for this item. I was given a number to call about the Firestick not working. I must have gotten the department or company covering the warranty. They were full of excuses to not replace the Firestick. The main one was that when I called, they told me the system they use for replacements was down. They took my contact information and said they'd get back to me. THEY HAVEN'T!My recommendation is to steer clear of a Firestick since both of ours failed only months after getting them. The first was easily replaced when I chatted with an Amazon rep; the second is still not working and the people I talked with (two of them) about it just gave me excuses, lies and that Firestick is still not working.Again, think about your purchasing this item and if you get a warranty, it's just a waste of money.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Worked great then remote died,Thought my batteries were dead in the remote.  Replaced batteries and it still does not work.  I now need to replace the remote which costs just as much as buying a whole new Fire Stick.  The design of the remote needs a lot of improvement.  Case that hold the batteries keeps sliding off when using the remote.  I checked to see if replaceable and it does not give me the option to submit a request.  Now deciding if I want to purchase another one which will fail again or go with another brand.,1
javier,Doesn't live up to expectations,"The product is of good quality overall however, there are one or two weakness/limitations that renders it worthless. 1. It does not allow mirroring of prime video to your from your phone to your TV. It only sends audio, no video at all. How can this be when I'm paying for prime and using FireTV, an amazon device, to mirror video from my paid app???2. It does not allow mirroring your phone to your TV unless you're connected to WIFI, what????Let's say your camping and you took your small TV, you'd like to watcha a Prime movie from your phone to your TV via FireTV, not possible unless you're connected to WIFI. Not every mountain comes with WIFI.BTW, all this was possible with and old version of the FireTV. How is that for providing the best products for your customers.......",1
Ken W.,Battery Issues,I have multiple Fire Sticks in my home and this is the worst one. I received a notification that the battery was extremely low and I needed to replace. I bought brand new AAA batteries replaced the ones in my remote and I keep getting the same error. I've looked for different suggestions on how to fix this none have worked. This is apparently a known issue. I'm replacing it with a Roku,4
Sal,"Used to be good. After ""updates"" no longer compatible if you have Verizon","My original Firestick was flawless. Then recently, it kept updating and finessing storage and every update made it work slower and slower until it basically barely works at all. Using it to watch Netflix it's great. But I can no longer connect to HBO Max and it actually buffers in the middle of programs and I have 320 Mps download speed. They talked me into buying the new 4K super-duper model of Firestick, and the problem is exactly the same. Spent hours talking to Amazon ""technical assistance"" people, most of whom either are incapable of understanding the answers you give to the questions they ask, and really, they don't ""know"" anything. They're just robotically reading from a script on a monitor. Giant waste of time. Sending my stick back. They can keep it. BTW - Amazon only gives a 90 guarantee on this device, a good indication of how much faith they have in it.",5
Vern,Bad Remotes,"We have figured out that we have to change the batteries every few days if we leave the batteries in the remote. We can go a week without having to change them if we remember to take the batteries out. When not using the television the batteries last longer, of course. Outside of remote. In all my many years I never had to change batteries in a remote, but every few years. The firestick seems okay. So far. It's the remotes that are bad. We wonder if the remote stays on through the alexa capability, thus draining batteries.????",3
gkhelland,Disappointed to say the least,"So we had a Fire Stick for over four years now. Last fall it started to lag, then Paramount Plus wouldn't always load, and it increasingly became a chore to use. So after calling tech support and getting nowhere, (I tried everything with the guy finally saying that he had no record of a Fire Stick associated with my account). We purchased a 4K Fire Stick. which was even worse than our first! It kept wanting to update, then kept throwing error codes, and finally just looped in a neverending restart mode. I took my old Roku, and tried everything on it; much to our surprise no reboots, updates, lags, or Apps that don't open. One week on and my whole household wants nothing to do with the Fire Stick. So Thanks Fire Stick, you just made us Roku Fans!",1
Fred B,"Prime Video judders on this stick, as does DirectTV Stream","The Prime Video app judders on this device (and 2 older Firesticks), and I've tried all the suggested settings to fix this including frequency and resolution, and the ""Match Original Frame Rate"" setting. I don't have the problem on the Prime Video app that runs natively on the same TV (LG). Network speed is wired (~90 MBps). We switched to a Roku 4k stick and have had no problems, and it's faster.",1
Ben,What a pile of Crap!,"Bought this about 10 months ago.... and nearly EVERYDAY it locks up and I wind up watching a spinning dial and NOT television!!!  Would NEVER purchase again... and total pile of crap. I've resigned myself to having to reboot (unplug and plug back in) this piece of junk to get it to work correctly.... for a while...and then back to a spinning dial.  And, NO, it is NOT my internet connection... I have a 500mb download internet speed, so that is not the problem...the problem is this Amazon pile of junk!!!  Purchase something else that actually works.,!!!",1
Megan Haynes,Garbage,"I’ve had many fire sticks and used them for years. They work okay, but generally have a lot of glitches and need to be restarted frequently due to freezing or because the audio and visual get unsynced. They also only last a couple of years and then stop working. Usually tell you it can’t connect to the network. I started buy Rokus about 5 years ago. I have two that are 5 years old and still work perfectly. Now whenever a firestick dies I replace it with a roku, they’re much more reliable and last longer. Shame that Amazon can’t keep up.",1
Keshav Das,AMAZON customer service on the Fire TV really sucks,"This fire Stick gets stuck in the first step in updating the software, the updating never ends, it just hangover there. I tried to reset it, ended up the same way, the software update never end hang at about 80% I followed customer service instructions holding the HOME and Back button for 20 seconds, factory reset, doesn't work.I rarely run into quality issues like this, this shouldn't have passed the quality check in the first place, what bothered me was for a $29 fire stick, when I run into trouble, and tested it over and over again, Amazon customer service in South Africa office (I do not know how I ended up in South Africa office) the customer service keep letting me jump the same hoop even though I have told her I've tried many times to factory reset it, it did not work, She did not seem to understand that the fire stick only cost me $29, but time dealing with her jumping through these hoops I knew for sure would fail would cost me a lot more than $29, because I have tried several times,  she still insist doing so, when I complained about the time wasted, she started to do the passive aggression.... I would say this was very rare, I am happy in dealing with most of Amazon customer service. but a bad one is really enough of bad taste in the mouth.",1
William F. McNamee,Don’t buy this POS!!!,"I purchased the fire tv stick to cut the cord from cable, I am severely disappointed in this product, I wasted multiple hours trying to pair the included remote (see pic), without success rendering the product useless.followed the details of amazons tutorial as well as multiple other you tube videos on the topic. So many videos that they know this is crapola.  Don’t waste your money, buy another brand and save yourself the massive headache that I have!!!",1
Merrill,Trash,Absolutely ridiculous! I had firestick as for about five years! Whenever they did this update they started going to the home sceeen while I was using them had done this over and over. I called customer service they told me I had the old Firestick and I needed to buy new ones to stop this from happening. Guess what I did and guess what it still happens Amazon customer service sucks as well no help with anything they need a serious change in systems! Nobody buy this crap product!,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Not happy,"I am disappointed that the fire stick has connected to my echo Alexa speakers and disconnected my soundbar.  The words coming out of the speakers do not match up with the person on the tv. After much research and three days of trial and error, I’m told to reset the firestick to the factory settings. When I do that, I’ll have to reprogram the firestick with the all program files and downloads I have paid for.  Seems there should be an easier way to stop Alexa from working with this product. Update: apparently, the first tech at Amazon gave me the wrong info which did wipe out the programming in the firestick. And Alexa was still working with my tv!  I then spoke with another tech at Amazon, who guided me through the steps to stop Alexa working with the tv/firestick. So now I’m stuck reprogramming the firestick the way I had it. At least the words are now matching up with the tv and not delayed.  Too bad the first tech wasn’t properly trained; however, I am grateful I got the second tech that actually had a clue.",1
Anthony  Lee,Desperately needs an app only mode,"This new 2021 interface that Amazon pushed to all its devices makes the device near impossible to set up for a parent or older person. There’s no way I can explain that 90% of the screen is an ad to my elderly parents. At least with the old interface, the recent app row was above the ads. Now there’s a banner ad and a suggested row before getting to the large app icons that they can actually see.Outside of a 3rd party launcher, there’s no way to make this usable for someone that doesn’t understand technology. Luckily the new googletv interface offers an app only mode. That’ll be my go to from now on. A once great eco system of FireTV devices is now more ads than function.",1
grokman,Bad product worse customer service,I could not get the 4K Fire stick to pair with my tv.  After almost an hour on the phone with tech support and still not working I asked for a new one to be sent to me and would return the one I just bought that was not working. I was told I was being sent a brand new 4K Firestick.  To my surprise I was sent a refurbished one and was very upset seeing I paid for a brand new one.  I called and spoke with an Amazon Leadership person named Alona A who said she could not send me a new one but could refund my money and I could keep the original non working 4K Firestick and the refurbished one and dispose of them of my choosing.  She confirmed this in an email sent to me.  I now just received an email from Amazon stating if I do not return the 4K Firestick they will charge me again for it.  This is absolutely the worst customer service. I know Amazon does not care but I do and feel extremely upset.  People be careful if you buy something and want to exchange it you most likely will get a refurbished item back.  And NO ONE AT AMAZON WILL CARE!!!!!!,1
dave,Horrible!,"Older firestick was continually requiring reboot, ordered the newest version to try to resolve.  New firestick constantly trying to update, but will not allow- says not enough memory and I need to remove some apps- I have a grand total of FOUR apps other than those Amazon includes with the firestick - and these cannot be removed.  Interface is a joke- 3/4 of your screen will be advertising Going to Roku",4
amanda,Very poor Wifi Hardware in this device,"I purchased 4k version to upgrade from the first generation Fire Stick, because the new interface was causing a lot of lag.  I figured a new stick with a better processor would be better.I got the 4k device connected it to my TV and connected to my router.  At best I could get a good connection.  I pulled it off and reconnected my old first generation Fire Stick and I got a very good connection.  Also, I have a Roku 4 connected to the TV that connects with an excellent connection.  I plugged the 4k back in and started to try and watch some shows on Prime and Netflix.  After 5 minutes the connection had dropped to fair and it wouldn't connect to the internet.I looked at all of the suggestions to help with the connection status (published by Amazon) and realized it was all an attempt to gaslight owners of the 4k into thinking the problem is with their router (move the router closer, add a repeater, connect with ethernet cable, blah, blah, blah).  Two other older devices connect to my router with great success, but the latest 4k stick is having issues.DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.  The Wifi hardware in the device is bad and Amazon won't admit that they have a bad product.Wait for the next generation and hope they get it right.",5
Y. Yin,The old one is better!,"I decided to go by this one to upgrade the prior fire tv we have. I regret!! It reboots every time I give Alexa a command, unlike the previous fire tv. I thought this was going to excel, but nah!! Money wasted. If I lived in the States, I would return it. I rather keep the old fire tv. That one works best!!!",3
Dave R,"No, just no","Before this, we had a FireTV stick, then a box, then a cube.  Now this.  Experience?  Absolutely horrible!  This is the 4th Amazon FireTV product I’ve ever owned (or tried to own).  This time, remote would not connect to it (despite it being a new device).  So we couldn’t even try to set anything up.  Our experience with previous Amazon FireTV devices was not good.  Tried to give the stick a chance again (for travel purposes) since they’ve supposedly made improvements, but have just come to see that it’s the same old useless junk.  I should have just trusted my gut and got a Roku stick instead.Stay away!  If it’s labeled FireTV anything, just turn around run.  When you compare these with other streaming devices in real life, you’ll see just how bad these Amazon ones really are.UPDATE 06/30/2022: Amazon sent a replacement stick and remote, and it also had the same problem as the first.  Even my partner (an IT/computer specialist) couldn’t get this thing to work.  These really are junk units.  Amazon fully refunded my money.",1
Branden Wise,This Fire TV Stick 4K Destroyed My TV in 1 Day - Killed My Power Board & TV will Not Turn On Now,"This Fire TV Stick 4K Destroyed My TV in 1 Day.  I installed the Fire TV Stick into my perfectly working Panasonic 55"" TV, watched it for a short few hours, and the next morning my TV would not even turn on. Spent hours on chat with SIX different Amazon reps and none of their suggested recovery steps worked. The Fire TV Stick killed my power board.The Amazon reps had the nerve to tell me that my TV being destroyed overnight by this Fire TV Stick 4K was ""a coincidence."" Can you believe that?I am a very hardworking nurse, working 12 hour shifts and even 24 hour doubles for the past 2 years during this pandemic. All I wanted to do was unwind watching a little TV, enhanced by the Fire TV Stick 4K. Instead, now I can't watch TV at all, because my TV won't even turn on.Not only do I not recommend this Amazon product, but I feel insulted by the Amazon reps who totally let me down.",1

Danny,Battery Drains Does Not Work more than a day,Terrible device.  Have had these before and they worked perfectly. AMazon updated the device remote and it drains the battery or does not recognize it after one day of use.  Terrible product update and they are not addressing the issue if you look online you will find numerous people reporting this and NO comment from Amazon!  If you are ok using the phone app (which will not control volume or on off of your tv) then it works.,1
Beverly,DO NOT BUY,"Device doesn't stay paired with TV, even after following the troubleshooting and resetting instructions multiple times. While streaming, the remote will stop working, and then you have to go up to the TV and it might pair up again. This is bluetooth. You don't need a direct line of sight- I looked it up.I had to replace the batteries DAILY- (the Amazon batteries that came with it didn't last a day).Tried to have item replaced- don't bother- there is no replacement option. I had to call Amazon- rep told me I had to talk with the troubleshooting team. I don't want to keep a device that didn't work for a day. I don't want the same thing to happen in a few weeks AFTER the ""you can return by"" date. They must have a lot of trouble with these devices. Don't do it!I'll just stick with my Roku device. Sad- I really wanted this to work.",1
Merrill,Absolutely piece of garbage,"I can't believe Amazon has such a bad device.  No wonder its 50% off even if it's free, I wouldn't use it as gives so much frustration.  The remote lags big time, doesn't respond to the click and then all of the sudden it just keeps moving all over when it finally recognizes the command many seconds later.  Even if you don't click as many times, when it acts, it moves like you clicked a 20 times.  Going to return this piece of sh...",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Defect piece,"I bought this Amazon firestick in October, initial days it was working fine.One fine day it stopped working, I thought the batteries were dead and replaced them with new then also it’s showing as batteries low and need to be replaced.I changed 3 set of batteries every time it’s showing as the batteries need to be replaced.",1
L. LaBarbera,It works....until it doesnt!!,"Bought this firestick 4k in August 2021 to replace an old second gen that was stuck in boot loop.. Worked great and was very pleased.. up until August 23 2022 when this new firestick also got stuck in boot up loop! Even with the prices dropping on older models, I cannot recommend you taking a chance with your money on something that may work a long time or may become useless at any moment.. It's very disappointing of such a good product. If you don't want your money at risk, look into other options....",1
Desert Lion,Finally moved on,"I'm sorry, but after trying google tv, I will never touch firestick again. The frustrations I've had on this device has drove me crazy. First off the clutter visually stresses me out, things lag too much cuz of all that's running on the screen, they handcuff you too much so that even though you finally get things running smooth, you can't access basic things. I basically had to use it without any home screen at all and without any launcher just to immediately remove the lag and clutter, cuz 3rd party launchers have too many issues as well I don't like. Firestick basically taught me how to be more tech savy cuz even though all that has drove me crazy, it's still a good streaming device if that kind of stuff never bothers you. But I don't like an inconsistent device that laggs so much and ruins my experience to the point where I gotta restart, scroll through adverts, use only one row, try to ignore 99% of the entire screen, just to get back to what I was trying to watch in the first place. Google just has everything available with easy AND and apps only mode too. Ok rant is over.",1
Doris Trochez,"Same crap product, now with daily reboots!","I hate myself for buying this crap. I’ve probably bought 10 of these pieces of crap now. If they worked they would be awesome, but they don’t. The latest one requires a daily reboot just to work. Yup, every 16-20 hours it just stops working and I have to get up (ON A FREAKING LADDER!!!) to power cycle this POS because the software sucks so freaking bad. Amazon is so obsessed with making it smaller, they never stopped to actually make the crap thing work. “Oohhh but look how small and cute.” Yeah who cares if the crap thing doesn’t work.  BUILD A FREAKING DEVICE THAT WORKS LOOSERS!  It doesnt matter what the user interface looks like if the damn thing is locked up 90% of the time.",1
wew1992,It never works. We haven't connected to our Alexa and that isn't any more helpful.,I am so tired of my fire stick never performing as it should. When you talk through the mic on the controller it doesn't understand anything you're saying. When you ask it to do a simple command like please play Hulu it doesn't understand and it won't respond. What is the point of having a fire stick with a mic if the mic never works. And when you connect your fire stick to Alexa and you ask her to play the shows it doesn't do any better.But what is really funny is as soon as I go up to the fire stick unplug it and plug it back in a few minutes later then all of the sudden it magically works again. But only for 24 hours the next day broken again. Every single day you have to unplug and plug this device back in just to get it to work the way it's advertised.,1
Amazon Shopper Cal,Eats Batteries Like Crazy!,We needed a new remote since our old one wasnt working well.  I really like that it controls the TV too.  I don’t notice any difference in quality or how it works.  I think the 4 buttons on the bottom should be programmable to the channels you use most.  We only use one of the options so the others are pointless.  The worst thing about this remote and really my only gripe is that it uses batteries like crazy.  We are using the remote the same as we ever have but it needs a new set of batteries almost daily.  We are using brand new Energizer Max AAA batteries and I thought maybe the whole package of batteries was bad so I bought another package and it’s the same thing.  That’s just plain crazy!  I’ve never had a remote use batteries like this.  I may have to order the older version remote because it didn’t use the batteries like this.  Very disappointed!!,4

SamCrit,Burnt out our 65inch smart TV after update,My husband and I bought this device because we heard good reviews about the product. We installed in our bedroom so we could watch tv while laying in bed (shows that our tv alone couldn’t get but the fire stick could)While I was getting  ready in the morning I would turn on the tv to listen to music.Last week I did my usual turned on the tv to get ready. After the tv turned on there was a message saying that the fire stick needed to update. It didn’t give me an option to update now or later like most products do but it didn’t and went right to the update. After the update completed my tv wouldn’t turn on it was a black screen. So now we have a 65 inch tv that doesn’t work.,1
praveen,Audio is out-of-sync most of the time on the 4K sticks :(,"I've been using FireSticks since 2015 and have 9 different sticks from different years. All have worked well, except for the new 4K sticks that I recently got in 2022. In my experience the 4K sticks have been constantly problematic for audio sync. The audio is out-of-sync most of the time and requires a reboot to fix the problem. But the reboot only fixes it temporarily, and it will eventually become out-of-sync again. I've been going back to the older non-4K pre-2022 sticks for better audio sync without any problems.",1

My request was to credit the $10 instead of me returning the device and ordering the new one, but was rejected. I can always return and purchase this at the lower price displayed on the site now, but just inconvenience and also money for the company to take back my device, shipping charge etc. Not sure whether this is a standard practice from Amazon or not, but wanted to provide a review on the same.",1
Jordan,Much slower and buggier than the non-4K FireStick,"I ""upgraded"" to the 4K version and it is not as good or reliable as the older, non-4K version. There are constant app crashes, app hangs, items not loading, poor (pixelated) video and streaming quality, and constant updates for both the stick and the remote. It's not reliable like the older one, you have to restart the stick much more often and reset it a lot. Too many glitches/bugs. Definitely not worth full price.",1
Derek W. Small,BUY A ROKU INSTEAD,"I've bought two amazon fire sticks. One a few days ago and one a few years ago and in both situations the remotes didn't pair and the interface was HORRIBLE.

The remote would pair for a second or not pair at all.On top of it all, every amazon customer rep had different information about EVERYTHING including the item's return. I was told I had to return it then I didn't have to return it then I had to FULL YEAR to return it. The tech people and general reps were all over the place in info.

James C.,"Good for a while, but then...","The first unit did not work.  Amazon took it back and issued a replacement.

Some message about checking settings.  I haven't had a chance to look into it.Did not try the Alexa integration.EDIT:  UTube TV quit working.  The only thing we could get on the TV was constant buffering with at most a word every several seconds.  UTube TV worked well on the computer.  Free TV worked well on the TV, so I figured the problem had to be in the Firestick.  Gave up on it.  Ordered a new TV (the old one  still worked, but had other problems).  The new TV works well without the need for a streaming device.Looked through the reviews for the Firestick.  There are many 5 star reviews, so it appears the idea for the device is good, but there are obviously problems.Kudos to Amazon for their customer service.

Dano,Sound drops and device must be restarted constantly,"Title says it all. Every 30-45 minutes the device pauses, sound cuts out and won't come back unless you power down and then up again. You can do a simple google search to find many many people with this issue, just search google for ""Firestick audio drop."" You'll get a ton of results dating back over 5 years. Not sure why Amazon won't address or fix the issue, you'd think they'd want one of their flagship products to you know actually work. When you talk to customer service all they will do is replace the device. This device is therefore useless. Save yourself much trouble and buy something else.",1
Linda Milazzo,Skip the B.S. improve UI,"Forced by silly setup UI to go through extra steps that are useless to me.  First choice should be to skip this, second step should also have skip this etc...Too simple for the UI team that owns this project to stand up to the upper level.Fire TV UI to move/remove apps is horrible.  Why not have the move option persist until the user is done moving apps.  Why display the options to move and then give the all powerful “Are you sure” prompt after selecting it.  Need to be able to remove proprietary apps that are not used nor will they ever be used.  Hiding is at least something but if they are never going to be used seems like inefficient and ineffective design.Next is the remote.  Why not give the ability to use the four hot keys as the user sees fit.  I get the Prime Video self promotion but the others may not be used.",1
Kevin P.,Disney Plus no longer works,"I spent 1 1/2 hours with Amazon and they could not help.  I spent 45 minutes with Disney.com and they said there is a known issue with the fire stick app for Disney plus.  It worked great until an update.After that, I can no longer get the login screen so when I changed my password it no longer worked.I have uninstalled the app at leas 20 times, cleared the data, cleared the Cache, unplugged the Tv, unplugged. The fire stick, unplugged the modem and the router.  I can use my computer to watch it but I want to see it on the TV.  The Roku stick works even though that’s 5 years old.  The 1st Apple TV works and that’s really old.  Amazon, get your act together.",1
KB,Doesn’t work with Disney+,"I bought this because it has a quick button for the exact 4 streaming services I subscribe to watch. It works great with all except for Disney+… it won’t connect and I’ve tried everything. Very disappointing and I’m not the first one with this issue. It’s posted all over the internet. Just search “fire stick won’t connect to Disney+“ and you will see. I wish I would’ve searched it before I bought it, because I wouldn’t have bought it if I knew it has had this problem for YEARS. Not a happy customer. It’s been like this for days on my device and it seems like a permanent problem… I’ve tried everything and nothing is fixing the issue. You have been warned.",1
Amy Cullen,Loss of Wi-Fi Signal = Worthless,"I have 2 sheetrock walls and 15 feet between my router and the firestick and it will not hold connectivity long enough to populate a menu. I've tried 2g and 5g and the results are the same and it's NOT the router. I have several phones, Alexa devices, a laptop and printer all around the house working perfectly on wi-fi. I have not exceeded the IP range of the router either. I opened it up long ago to avoid any reasonable possibility of that happening. It just won't stay connected - period.Something is definitely wrong with the device or internal antenna. Not a chance in hell it could have this many positive reviews if this was normal operation.Now I get to take it to a drop off location. Hooray for me!",4
Marcus Brown,Tons of Ads and poor streaming quality. Get a Nvidia Shield and enjoy a better experience.,"Do you want your tv shows and movies interrupted mid stream on a daily basis? Did you want a remote with a power button that does NOT turn off the device? Last one, how about daily interruptions so Fire TV can update an Android App it doesn't even use? Obviously it is a bug, but the biggest company in the world is too cheap too fix. I regret buying the first generation, and regret buying the second generation. I have told them 3-4 times now, get a month refunded, but never fixed. Waste of time and really poor quality. Its cheap for a reason: Tons of ads everywhere and the cheapest software development on the market compared to Nvidia and ROKU.",5
David Cole,I wanted to like the firestick,"Could not get past registration. Product kept freezing at the same spot. Was sent 4 different units and got the same result on all 4. Got a roku, basically same set up, and thing worked within 30 seconds of unboxing. Now I’ve got to box up and send back 4 fire sticks and have another roku on the way. Save yourself the time!",3
Merrill,Unreliable and a constant annoyance.,"I have been using (trying) this Firestick for several months now. When it decides to work - it works well. However when watching videos it constantly freezes and has to be reset. Buffering is also a huge issue.All in all, completely unreliable and just another source of daily annoyance. There are several videos online showing how to correct these type of issues but none of them were successful. I have stopped using it and removed it from my TV.Would not buy again under any circumstances.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Bluetooth volume does not work,"I have updated the firestick, I have updated the remote, I have restarted the stick and pulled the batteries out of the remote. I still can not control volume or mute volume over Bluetooth. This is kind of a major flaw.Update: I knew this wasn't a problem on my dad's 4k Max so I purchased my own Firestick 4k Max and now I have Bluetooth volume control. This is obviously a firmware bug in the cheaper 4k and tech support doesn't understand.",1
Cowboyrebel,Tooo  difficult for older people to learn.,"Print is too small...white letters on black hard to read....with low vision, much prefer old cable that we had.  Then we could type in channel number.  Guide is too small to read and hard to navigate.Would really like video description.Hard to fast forward when can't see pictures well.Just do not like streaming tv at all.",1
Melisa Walker,Rip off!,"I have been soo happy with FireTV as it's a great product but when I had ordered two by accident, I purchased another then noticed that I Pais $49.99 went to return this item and I was ripped off as the refund went from $49 and now price is $29 so I wanted to return one but Amazon would only refund me $29 so basically they made me lose $20 which is completely crooked!!! Another tactic for Amazon to keep $20 since I paid $49 but only approved a refund of $29 so I lost $20. Inappropriate and not ethical. Just another trick Amazon uses to steal your full refund.",1
Joshua Warren,Worst remote ever!,Good luck getting the remote to work when you need it every time I pick it up I have to hold home button and go out of the app I was using then back in doesn’t matter if it’s 1 min 30 secs in the middle of selecting options or hours later. I have had these for years this is by far the worst experience and the resolution was to send my entire stick and remote back in on warranty so I would be without tv umm no?! Send me a new remote would be more of a resolution. This may be the last firestick i purchase,1
Nightly night,Amazon Remote seems to lack Technology,Bought this for a friend who doesn't have much so he could possibly stream free TV channels.  I have had several firesticks and never encountered to many issues.  However the remote for this newer 4k version is garbage.  Spent hours trying to get it to connect to the firestick with no success.  Found multiple websites and YouTube videos confirming that Amazons remotes are shall we say lacking.  In todays tech world something as simple as bluetooth and connecting two pieces from the same vendor should be a no brainer.  I guess Amazon hasn't gotten the message.  Sent an email to their support via my friends email - so far no response - we will see what the outcome is.,1
Michael Gliozzi,Beware!,"This was a terrible experience.  I ordered the Firestick and couldn't get it to pair with Alexa.  I troubleshooted with an Amazon tech and she hung up on me when we couldn't fix the problem. This happened TWICE.On the third try the agent said I had the wrong device and would mail me another.The same problem occurred with the second one.  Another agent worked with me for about 45 minutes and couldn't solve the problem.  She said she was going to investigate and also email me a return authorization.  I never heard back from her and she didn't send the return authorization.I called the Best Buy Geek Squad.  Ended up having to have someone to come to the house since a phone agent couldn't fix it either.  As it turns out, after he worked with both sets, he said both were defective.Thank goodness I subscribe to total tech support.Very frustrating!",1
reb55,Worthless,"I bought this 4K Firestick to replace the previous model which I unfortunately left in a hotel room.  This one worked well when I set it up, but was very difficult to connect with hotel wifi systems when I was traveling which was one of the main reasons for purchasing a Firestick.  Shortly thereafter it began to get difficult to connect with my home system and a couple months after my purchase did not work at all.  Amazon was good to honor the warranty and sent me a replacement stick (refurbished).  Unfortunately that one didn't work at all so Amazon sent me another refurbished replacement.  That one would not pair with the remote.  Amazon offered to send me another replacement stick, but after 3 strikes I asked for a refund.  I purchased a Roku which is working very well.",1
S square,Slow and not worth it. Get a ROKU.,"Fire sticks work great out the box , but add an app or two and you’re screwed.I went Roku for this. Just waiting on this one to take over 30 seconds opening an app. Right now it’s 17 seconds. And FYI. ALL troubleshooting steps done. Including more than fast internet speed.",1
Rainer,CRAP,"I dont no whats wrong with the Lite version but its crap, one min there is no sound the next its no wifi . I spend more time goin in my son room to get it to work , then he does watching tv.",1
ScratchThat,Faulty Remote,"I just received my new Fire Stick on Aug. 21, and every day since about the third day, the remote has not worked. It won't even turn on the TV. We have replaced the batteries each day, and most days the remote works after we do that, but obviously who can afford to change batteries every day?! Today, even changing to new batteries did not work. Now, I'm faced with having to send back the Fire Stick and Remote and wait for another one to be sent. I did  that apparently this is a fairly commoon factory problem. Seriously? I expect better from Amazon.",4
Michele Harris,My Firestick,I have bought and returned 4 of these Amazon firesticks. I returned all of them for a replacement. The same thing keeps happening. I put a show on and I get NO VIDEO. I feel like its the 1970's when we only had 3 channels.I am very disappointed.,5
Merrill,Alexa on the device sucks big time. It disconnects my Fire TV from my TV.,"Whenever I use my voice to search something, the Fire TV operating system crashes and then the screen says ""No Signal"" or takes me to another HDMI slot on my TV.It then fails to come back to Fire TV homescreen.At times, I had to unplug (remove power source as well) my Fire TV stick and then stick it back again just to make sure that it works.Scarring experience as I avoid using my voice to search anything on this device as I am 100% sure that there is some software issue and Instead of getting the relevant search results, Alexa will disconnect my device.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Good while it lasted…which wasn’t very long,It was good while it lasted. Which was unfortunately only 6 weeks. The remote completely drains the batteries in about 3 hours and then dies. After about 6 batteries I just stopped replacing them. Tried every troubleshooting option possible and nothing help. Had to download the Fire TV app which is a pain because sometimes it doesn’t even connect to the device.,1
Amazon Customer,Worthless,"Bought the new one & it's not one bit better. Live tv is the worse, constant freezing & loss of audio. Prime tv is not worth the hassle. Always buffering & I have the fastest Cox cable, top notch modem & router. I don't need this aggravation.",1
Texun,Amazon is selling a know defective product,"Just had a horrible experience trying to get a replacement for the defective unit I was delivered, only to have Ryley let me know that their supervisor said that the remote not pairing is a ""known issue"", they wouldn't process a REMOTE replacement (when I asked for a full unit one), and that my inability to pair would be forwarded to the tech team.THAT was the response I was given before I had to fight for a refundUtterly unacceptable that Amazon sells a known defective product and the entire experience I had with Ryley was completely dismissive and took 20 minutes to get my refund.I should also mention that I was put into an infinite loop while trying to process a refund myself and was forced into talking to someone to get a resolution (which was a horrible experience)Would give a 0 if I could",1
Jeff Bendel,Can't control AVR and TV at the same time.,"This unit may be defective.  I have other Firesticks that work with AVRs and TVs but I'm returning this one.  My old STD DEF unit works fine.This unit could set the AVR for control but as soon as you turned the TV on it reset.  There might be a clash in AVR and TV codes that tickles something in this unit but I have no way to know.BTW, I have three 4k Firesticks and one STD DEF.  All work fine and are 5-star in my opinion.",1
Luke Shilling,Ruined my $600 LG tv,Installed the 4k Fire stick and my screen began blinking on and off repeatedly!  Researched and found this is an issue and tried several fixes.  None of them worked and now I cannot watch tv!.  I had zero problems with this tv until I installed this stick.  Now I am stuck without recourse.  I also would like to note that I previously had a Fire tv box….an older one…… that I was replacing with the stick.  It had worked fine for several years.  I also own 2 other Fire tv sticks for my other tvs and there have been no issues.  I am so disappointed and angry that large tv is ruined.,1
Buckeye HD Rider,Remote Issues,I purchased this as a replacement for an older device whose remote quit working. The remote for this device is now not working. It is draining batteries and requires new batteries daily. Apparently it is a known problem to their tech group but it is an expensive problem and a huge inconvenience since the remote unpairs about 50% of the time this happens. Trying to find out if it isolated to the 4K or if it’s happening to all versions. Steer clear of this until it’s corrected.,1
Bishy,Worthless device...almost as worthless as Amazon customer service.,Device freezes and drops out every 15 to 20 minutes. Have to unplug from power source and re-boot constantly. Tried to start a return to exchange it for a new device and customer service just sends me in an endless loop back to the original return process repeatedly asking for the same information. I replaced an old fire tv box (had it for 7+ years with no issues) with the stick and will be going back to the old box.,1
Jo Perry,Faulty Remote,We keep having to replace the batteries in the remote very often. Not sure if this is a manufacturing fault but ive noticed this complaint with the newer generation of fire stick. Not sure how to get it replaced!,1
Jason Mairs,Issues with it giving a dead battery notice every 18 hours,Never had an issue with any of my fire sticks had my first one for 3yrs no issues. But this 4K one just keeps eating batteries spent 21.00 on batteries and still had to replace every day to make it work so I ended up having to buy a replacement even though it is only 2 months old,1
Debra McKee,Broke after 3 days of usage,"Bought this 50 dollar firestick during prime days for 25 dollars.  If it would've been 50 I'd b throwing more of a fit. This is in my and husband's bedroom so never gets touched by kids. After THREE DAYS of using it maybe a handful of times if that, the center button doesn't work so I'm not able to click on anything which makes the entire thing completely useless. Won't b buying another firestick and will b sticking with ROKU!! NOT HAPPY ABOUT WASTINF EVEN MORE MONEY ON AMAZON PRODUCTS THAT ARENT WHAT THEY SHOULD B. almost seems as if all Amazon products, as they get more popular, the worse quality everything is.",1
Wetz,Remote control goes through batteries like mice through cheese.,"The fire stick works great as long as the remote batteries are fresh. After a few days of non use, the batteries are dead an the remote is no longer paired. Pain in the a$$. Not what I was looking for.",4
Merrill,Bait and switch! Typical Amazon!,"Our old fire tv displayed a promo - 20$ off to upgrade - Had to use the phone app to complete the order, took multiple tries as the app is not made for like a remote. Got it done. Received in the am next day! Dang that was fast! Looked at the bill - nothing off. Spoke with customer service.....According to the terms and conditions of the promo.This is a limited time offer. Qualifying customers only.Amazon reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer at any time.Offer only applies to Fire TV Stick 4K with all-new Alexa Voice Remote, streaming media player sold by Amazon Digital Services LLC.And then.....Upon checking, we have no longer the option to give the 20$ for the promo.GrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrJust another unsatisfied customer and yet another return!",5
Mark R. Wietstock,Worst fire stick I've ever received,"Worse experience with a firestick, I have 7 in my house but this one sucks, the remote turns the TV on but the firestick has to be unplugged & plugged back in for it to work😡😡 I did the reset & it worked one day, think o need a replacement.",3
Mary Ann Evans,Waste of money,"It worked for the first 2 days, after the control would no work & I would have to change the batteries every single time I wanted to turn it on or change the channel. It eventually stopped working. Had it less than a month.",1
Bill S.,Only worked for a few months.,"Remote died.  Fire stick stuck at menu.  Tried everything, unplug & replug, changed batteries, press and hold buttons mentioned in problem shooting.  Nothing worked.  Nowhere to talk to person for help. Very frustating!",1
Hernan Cespedes,A miss on understanding customer satifaction,Unfortunately our first experience with our fire stick did not go well. The stick did not boot up to the setup instructions. Followed by a technical support call that did not meet a customer satisfaction criteria. I ordered the Firestock in the morning and installed it about 10 hrs later. When requesting a replacement on a same day order I was given the option of only replacing the fire stick itself and a delivery  2 days later. Asked if they could just send me a whole new fire stick set with next day delivery I was told no,1
Gsp,This thing is trash.,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 This thing is terrible. It barely works. It randomly restarts itself all the time. I am actually going to have to call Amazon about this. It has one job, stream stuff, and it doesn’t seem to like doing it. I have trouble shooted the daylights out of this thing. It’s updated. It’s the original chord and power brick. It’s a brand new really nice tv. So annoying!",1
anita jones,how is this an upgrade,"It takes forever to load ANYTHING.  Unbelievably inefficient hardware components.All tech support wants to tell me is that I have to reset my wireless router, but I promise it is not the wireless signal as no other device is having issues - just the FireTV stick.  Right out of the box it wouldn't download the update - nor would it work without updating first.  After maybe 20 power cycles - I'm not exaggerating - the stick finally downloaded the update.  Now it takes an EON to load any menu - the worst of which is HBO max.  After 10 minutes of loading menus, I then have to wait several minutes before a video actually begins to play.Again - this has NOTHING to do with the internet connection as the OLD fire stick had no issues.  I bought this as an upgrade to the old fire stick since it could no longer handle the new update.  The old one was great for years.  This feels like a hardware downgrade... I'd return it but the old stick is now obsolete.  So I'm stuck waiting for eternity.",1
FCRP,Have to change batteries every 7-10days,"I have used Fire Sticks for years and have always been happy and recommended them to others.  I bought two of this model, the picture quality and functions of the stick are good.  I gave this model one star because I have to change batteries every 7-10 days, this is getting expensive.  Amazon replaced one remote with a refurbished one, will see if there is an improvement.  I now take the batteries out when not in use.  I am no longer a happy customer, I no longer recommend Fire Stick to others.  I’m ready to switch to Roku.",1
Amazon Customer,A Battery Killer,"Purchased this unit around the 3rd of June, and at first, I thought I was purchasing bad batteries. I found out that the Fire TV remote was draining my batteries at the rate of two a day.",1
Abby Clabaugh,Durability and Life of product is terrible,My family and I love this product but my 1 star problem is the life of the fire stick. They have not lasted longer than a few months. And the warranty process takes a week to get a replacement - meanwhile you can order a new one and receive it in 2 days. This process or product needs tweaking.,1
Melodie,Too old to appreciate all the features,"Fire stick very small, buttons not clearly identified, on/off, volume, guide, etc. This product is not geared toward senior citizens.  We are watching sparklight,not using streaming features;  fewer working TV's in our household and cost is higher.  System is geared for a much younger generation.",1
Matt,SERIOUSLY AMAZON?,"The Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device is truly amazing. With the additional apps offered in the App Store, there is something for everyone in the family from cartoons dating back to the 1960’s and before to action, adventure, sci-fi and documentaries of the 21st century.I only gave this a 1 star review because -even though the entire system was under warranty-  after 3 weeks when it suddenly stopped working, Amazon sent me a used remote as a replacement 😡.  A USED REMOTE and that’s it? SERIOUSLY AMAZON?  I got one bad apple and you replace it with a dried up seed.",1
Merrill,Avoid,My fire tv stick got stuck on the logo screen after automatic update routine.Amazon customer support said they are aware of the problem and trying to fix it on their end. They said it may take a while and asked me to be patient (meaning having no streaming for indefinite time…).It has been days without a solution and when I asked them to replace it they told me it is out of the 1 year warranty. I told them it is not a warranty issue because they actually bricked the device with a bad update. They don’t deny that fact but still will not replace with a new unit and I now have a brick with no support.Amazon do not stand behind their own products the way they used to and I’m only getting an overseas support with bad english and robotic behavior.I am canceling my years long prime membership and getting my content elsewhere.Shame on you Amazon.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Didn't work out of the box,"I finally broke down and ordered a Fire Stick, intending to replace my Roku. So far it has been nothing but a disappointment. The brand new Fire Stick wouldn't pair with its brand new remote control, and when I attempted to contact customer service through the website provided in the instruction they tried to charge me for customer service. Came to Amazon (dot) com and contacted customer service through here, and after several minutes of preparing the exact same steps I had already tried, I now am waiting on a new remote control. You're not off to a good start, Amazon, I expect a new product, especially one with the type of hype given your Fire Stick, to work properly out of the box the first time. If the new remote works I will improve my review, if not, I expect a full refund.",1
rbpeirce,Fire stick burn out,Fire stick would not work even with customers service he wanted me to buy a 200 e card which made no sense but you cannot get the code to work so I want to return and the 2 year warranty,4
Kathy N.,Fire stick got on fire!!!! dont even know what to think,"I recently got this device because I was told they work really well on 4k devices and the 1st week they worked just fine. Anyways, on Monday, May 12-year-old daughter was watching tv and suddenly she got an error message saying fire stick 4k stopped working and 2 minutes after that the device got on fire. She was home alone because I just had left the house to buy some food. she called me terrified because the device got on fire and right after the TV got on fire So I had to drive back home super fast to stop the fire.  Thanks god I was fast enough to make it home on time and shut the fire down, This could have burned my whole place down. I lost my tv but I could have lost everything here . I dont think I will use your services again. now I have to take $1.300 to get and new TV and replace the furniture",5
Jacki,Device is being stuck on Downloading software,"This is a really bad experience. I was not able to set up the stick. The device was always being stuck on downloading the latest software. I tried to multiple approaches to fix this issue, including rebooting the device, resetting the device to the factory setting. None of them works. No other choice. I kept the TV on. After 1.5 hour, the log in screen was shown up. I used my account to log in. After retrying for 3 times, the device was finally registered with my account. When I watched the movie, the blurred screen was shown up after playing the movie for 1 minute. I rebooted the device and retried. The issue was exactly same. I have been using Fire TV Stick for 6 years. I purchased this new device for getting better experience. But I am totally disappointed. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow customer to give zero negative star rating. So, I give this product the lowest rating.",3
Russell A. Spencer,Horrible experience,"Hands down one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. I bought this, trusting amazons direct product, only to be extremely disappointed. IT WILL NOT CONNECT WITH REMOTE. I tried all the trouble shooting in the book, then on this app, then on YouTube. Still not working. I called and explained that I ordered this so I have tv when I move 8 hours away. They say they can’t help me because they can’t ship me a replacement or refund because my info wasn’t updated. I’ve been a prime member for a LONG time, and order stuff ALL THE TIME. I have a horrible taste in my mouth about it currently. Not to mention, I explained I was frustrated, and the customer service agent seemed to think it was funny, and make sly remarks. If I could leave less stars I would.",1
:0,Can't Unlock Get Older Firestick,"All Firesticks are not the same. This one cannot be unlocked so you can add whatever apps you want.I'd suggest you looking at an older model.

Branden M.,Failed.,Took an hour of searching the web to find something that would help me get this to work. Amazon help was useless. Finally got it to work for 3 days and it just quit. Nothing. It’s just dead. Ready to toss it and try Roku.,1
Kyle,Updated remote is crap,"I ordered this over 2 weeks ago and it came with same day Prime shipping.  I went to set it up and the remote would not pair with the device.  I got this to replace another 4k Firestick that worked but the batteries on the remote depleted and needed replaced DAILY.  I contacted customer service the day after I tried to set up the device that would not pair with the remote.  I went through several things with them on the phone that I had already tried.  In the end, they said that it was defective and would ship a replacement.  I am STILL waiting for a replacement, the shipment keeps getting delayed.  I don't know how it is possible to order something and get it the same day but it takes so long to get a replacement....",1
Waz Toro,If only it liked to work,We’ve had this 4K Fire Stick for a couple of weeks and it’s been glitchy since day 1. It reboots several times an hour and the video color sometimes turns completely pink and other times completely white with purple accents. It’s bizarre and annoying. We realize the issue is specifically with the 4K stick as our other non-4K sticks work perfectly (both new and older ones).,1
Billy DVD,If I could give it 0 I would.,Second time I’ve bought one of these (I’m an idiot I know). The remote stopped working after a month. Tried the TS steps and never worked again. After month five it stopped working all together. None of the troubleshooting steps worked and it’s now going in the trash. Get a Roku or good smart tv instead. Don’t buy this cheap garbage.,1
Edwin,Not worth my time...go back to cable,"Without parental control, stations automatically use credit card without permission. I fixed that problem  by setting parental control with a pin number which caused the problem of constantly putting pin number in which was so annoying, I took it out and went to Spectrum for an additional cable box.  Cheaper with Spectrum as there's no charges for channels. Unfortunately, the representative from amazon chat refused to allow me to return it. An additional issue is every Fire Tablet & devices are connected to it as well. This setup needs improvement, such as NOT connecting to Amazon & credit card. THAT I am unable to reverse.",1
Merrill,Storage space extremely limited!,"It is very disappointing that the available storage on the device is not ample to load a few basic apps.  I am constantly receiving messages of not having enough space and need to clear cache, that works for one day till it’s necessary again. It also drops out of the application during mid stream because when fire stick is full you don’t get best performance. I have only the basics loaded - Hulu, Showtime, Netflix and Starz.  Super frustrating.  Also can’t delete the Amazon preloaded apps to gain more space. I don’t use any of those except prime video, wasted space.  Searching other options to fire stick like Roku.  I will be done with fire stick until they allow you to delete their apps to gain space or simply increase storage.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Only last for one year!,Keep getting error 1061. Required restarting the stick to watch shows. I you buy it expect no support other than a poor community forum. If you really want one buy a 2 year warranty!,1
Karla ,Worthless piece of crap,Bought two together. First one quit working in 10 days. Second one quit a month later. Amazon refuses to replace them. Customer service is a freaking joke. They don’t care about issue with their product.,1
I Lo,The remote quit working 3 days after it was installed.,"Everything seemed to be working fine and after turning the TV off for the evening the remote would not work the next morning. I called the help line and the lady tried to get it working again by having me reboot it, but it still did not work. The remote and Fire stick quit pairing with one another. She ordered me a new remote. I’m wondering if this is common or not. What a hassle!",4
Tom,Poor Amazon Service/Support,We received this as a new item on January 2nd and were excited to get it to replace an older model which had stopped working.  Unfortunately this unit stopped working after only 3 months of use.  When we reached out to Amazon after doing some trouble  shooting we were offered a replacement.  The replacement arrived quickly but to our disappointment a 3 month old item was replaced with a refurbished item.  So we have a defective unit and we get someone else's defective unit as a replacement.  The replacement we could not get the remote to pair up with the refurbished unit and support indicated that the remote must also be bad and are sending a new one which will take 6 days to get here.  Honestly I am extremely disappointed in Amazons response to this problem.,5
MJM,Amazon forces updates and if they brick your device make you buy a new one,"There is no way to opt out of updates.  Then when the device gets stuck in the update loop they say you must purchase a new one and give you a 15% off.  If you complain enough they offer a 25% off purchase of a new one.  Sorry but you bricked my device with your forced updates, I'm going another route.",3
Al,Very Disappointed,"I got to use the Firestick for 2 days for maybe an hour each time. After that the remote just seized to work, wouldn’t connect to the fire stick, went through every tutorial possible to reestablish the connection and nothing. Tried new batteries, the alkaline ones they recommend, still no luck. Tried unpairing my other tv remote to not disrupt frequency between them, nothing. I’ve spent probably 5 hours messing with it and still no luck whatsoever. Would love to be refunded or sent another to try again. :(",1
13stars,Don’t buy it. Didn’t last three months,We used it less then a dozen times in just over two months before it started flashing a black screen with the audio cutting out. Apparently this happens a lot bc it’s under the trouble shooting area.Amazon’s solution is to just reduce the quality of the show your streaming. We had it down to 240 and it was still flashing. Call Amazon and they say. “Try unplugging it.” Wow. And it is not my tv or WiFi bc the smart function on the tv still works fine it’s just a pain to use.Can’t return it and Amazon doesn’t want to send a replacement. So I would recommend avoiding this and getting anything else.,1
J.D,Garbage.,"I’ve been using this FireTv Stick for over a year now and I couldn’t be more disappointed. When compared to an Apple TV 4K, this is literally the “Walmart” of streaming devices. It’s cheap, available, and will do the job in a pinch. Other than that…I couldn’t be more frustrated. Even with a 115 MBps connection, it’s still buggy, laggy, and an overall disappointment. If you want cheap, you got it. If you want something that will work, without frustration, look elsewhere.",1
Amazon Customer,OUTDATED BY NEW TV,"I have purchased 4 of these FIRE STICKS since they were first introduced. They worked  great on my older TV's and on the TV's in many hotel rooms. However, after purchasing 2 new TV's this year, I realized these FIRE STICKS are obsolete. Specifically, for the past several years all TV's come with built in apps identical to those provided by the FIRE STICK (including AMAZON MUSIC and AMAZON PRIME VIDEO). Consequently,  there is now no need to tie up an HDMI and USB port on the TV with the FIRE STICK not to mention there is no need for 2 remote controllers not the inconvenience of registering accounts like NETFLIX twice - once for the TV app and again for the FIRE STICK app. I will still keep my latest FIRE STICK in my suitcase to use on business trips since many hotels have yet to upgrade their TV's to the newer models with the built in apps - but they will, in time.",1
Donna Olson,This product sucks,I can no longer watch any of the apps I’ve downloaded and can’t figure out what is wrong. It definitely isn’t plug and play. Lasted only a few months. It’s like it took an update and I can no longer sign in with my tv provider on apps. Apple TV is much better even though you can’t get to the internet.,1
Lydia James,Stopped working,"After having this a very short time, it stopped working. I changed batteries. I can only turn it on/off and adjust volume. Nothing else works. Alexa button, home button, guide- nothing works.It stinks since I just bought 2 of these and it’s the only remote for TV’s. Disappointed in product. Now I’m worried the 2nd one will stop working as well.",1
Merrill,Didn't last a year,"I own 2 Fire TV sticks and the 4K Fire tv stick. I bought the 4K Fire tv stick in February 2022 and as of November 2022, it no longer functions. I will not buy a replacement.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Worked great until it didn't,"Responsive system, but remote stopped working after one year. Changes batteries, tried resetting, unpairing/repairing but no fixes working. Now I'm stuck with deciding if I want to buy a new fire stick every year try a different brand.",1
Gil Yaron,This is very poor TV service,I hate this streaming service………you have to switch to the guide to be able to change channelsThere is a lot of wait time..in switching to the guide & backAlso the wait time as the blue cicle goes around & around,1
Christel johnson,Terrible.,I ordered a new 4k fire stick to replace my older model. When it arrived it worked okay for a few days and then had streaming issues. Constantly had to restart and reconnect. Thought it was my internet connection but all my other Wi-Fi products worked fine. Sometimes it wouldn’t work at all. When I tried to get help to replace it Amazon made it seem like I was doing something wrong and didn’t want to replace it. Just told me to keep restarting it.,1
Mattie Lipscomb,WARNING DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is my second generation Firestick and in general I love it.  However it sucks the battery life so fast that I’ve had it for 3 weeks and have had to replace the batteries four times.  The batteries I installed yesterday just died.  Naturally I googled the issue and this is a known problem without a fix, so yes I can go through the hassle of a replacement only to get another one with the same problem.  Don’t waste your money until there is a fix.",4
steve rodel,New Home Screen format is a pain in the neck!,"Amazon recently decided to reformat the Fire TV Home Screen and made features more difficult to navigate.  There used to be a banner at the top where I could select ""Free to Me"" which eliminated all selections that required an extra charge.  Now I have to scroll through selections that I have no interest in buying.  On top of a recent price increase for Prime, this additional step is just one more annoyance designed to lure customers into emptying their pockets to keep the Amazon empire growing.",5
Jacky X.,Absolutely Horrible,Don’t Waste ur money get a roku!! Absolutely unhappy with this product!! Our roku which lasted us 5 year went out finally I decided to try this Firestick that’s supposed to be amazing!! Well the voices don’t match up when u watch a movie!! Makes watching movies frustrating cause u see people taking but don’t hear what they say til 3 seconds later!! I won’t ever buy this product again,3
Michael Lalonde,Bad build quality!,As a device designed to stream content yes it works and it works as it should. But I own 5 and every single one of the devices HDMI port is non functional or intermittently functional if the TV gets nudged or the cord get nudged it power cycles. Making every single one useless. Buy a Google TV build quality is substantially better.,1
Sunlyonis,disconnected from internet often,This firestick is great especially if you have Amazon prime you can watch great tv shows and movies and the pictures quality is superb. The only downside I experienced with this is that you have to connect it to the internet like 2 per  times per week even if your already connected. sometimes your watch a movie and it just disconnects from the internet.,1
TNJ,A product that does not relate as programmed,"I started prime video with a lite fire stick and recently purchased two others, one for the current TV because I believed it would be a better experience and the other for a LG plasma TV I am about to add to my service.I went into the prime philosophy slowly and realize the complicated way these products can relate but did not for me.I Have all three registered thru amazon and could not get the system to recognize me.After one hour I sought out help but the phone service was no longer an option and the bot help couldnt adapt and by that time I began to feel too sick to continue  due to elder health issues.I hope to get this straightened out and in no means intend insult just not everyone can do the same thing.There were other help pages but were not visible on my computer to continue with the prompt.,because I couldn't see it even though I almost removed the dock.I reverts back to the lite stick.,and after about 15 minutes I was reconnected, so it is this product.Thankyou",1
Amazon Customer,Worthless,"Not sure why but the new model is useless for people like me who use headphones with the tv and firestick, Old 1 I had the sound was fine but the new 1, useless junk to me, If you use headphones because you can't hear the tv sound as good then avoid firestick, it will be useless to you, Why does a company never ask advice from people that use a product then design it for what people want, Pathetic,",1
Jeff Siegel,Remote drains batteries within a day,I have had this device less than a year and have had to replace the batteries in the remote more than I can count. It’s at the point where it won’t last more that 24 hours before running out. Contacted Amazon and all they could do was offer a %15 discount for an entire new device. I looked it up and it seems it can be a common issue that Amazon chooses to ignore.,1

Ryan  O,8 DAYS OLD - IT STOPPED WORKING!,"It was good while it worked, but no w again YouTube won’t play the videos.  I’ve now gone through 3Amazon Fire Sticks in 2 weeks !  The Fire Stick that I bought on a Black Friday sale, my old one, stopped playing YouTube.  I unplugged, rebooted, multiple times, no go…  I bought an Amazon Fire 4k for approximately $54.00 with one day shipping.  That one lasted 11 days only…. Then I found this cheaper one with a deal, 8 days no YouTube again!  I’m returning the $54.00 one, and this one.  I’m done with Amazon streamers.  I sent lots and lots of messages to YouTube and to Amazon about the issues.  I don’t care for Amazon technology in general.  This is another huge failure for Amazon technology.",1
Kindle Customer,Stutters like crazy,"Too much bloat and stuff running in the background. Stutters and video jitters all the time no matter what. Thousands of complains once you start searching for a solution. Apparently this has been going on for years now, Amazon knows this and they still haven't fixed. No Chromecast compatibility either, only Airplay. For Chromecast you need to purchase an app.Overall, not worth it. I bought it to replace a Roku Stick and a Chromecast with a single device, but it simply doesn't cut it. Back to my trusty Roku that plays everything without issues, plus it also has private listening, something I also wish this device had.",1
David Henry,Broken,"Once again for the third time we have another broken fire stick. Doesn't usually power up has to be unplugged and plugged back in, disconnects from the wifi, can't connect to the remote. I'll have to return it",1

Heather Speir ,Not worth it to upgrade,"I kept getting ads for this to replace my old model at a discounted rate that really wasn't as discounted as they made it seem - $20 off ""list"" means only $10 off. But I got it hoping that ""that mouse channel"" wouldn't be a completely frustrating s-show everytime we tried to watch it, but it's the same bad stream quality. As far as Alexa, I DO NOT want any of that voice recognition at all. It's not that hard to press a button which you have to do with Lady A anyhow. Just stay with your old model.",5
Craig Rehor,FIRESTICK SUCKS!!  I SWAPPED ALL 7 FIRESTICKS FOR GOOGLE CHROMECAST,"I have 7 firesticks & they all suck!  CONSTANT buffering issues, shows will stop for no reason & it sends you back to the home page.  I'm convinced that Amazon doesn't want to work with Hulu as any Hulu app/show has twice as many issues as any other streaming service.  Shame on Amazon as they are only hurting their customers by doing this.  I SWAPPED ALL 7 FIRESTICKS FOR GOOGLE CHROMECAST & HAVE ZERO ISSUES!!  NO BUFFERING, NO STOPS/FREEZES, NO RESETS.  THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING.",3
Dawn Boulac,Remote Stopped working,I installed my fire stick on to my TV in Feb 2022. It's not even 3 full months & the remote just stopped working. I tried changing the battery but that did not work. Several attempts to pair the remote also did not work. This is the second time i face this issue as my previous Amazon stick stopped working & had issues with remote. This is disappointing & frustrating when a new item stops working. Purchasing or replacing the remote is not easy as well as it will cost me same money that i spent to buy the whole things. What a shame that Amazon can not ensure quality control of their own products....,1
K. Gerhart,Would've Been Nice If It Worked,"The remote wouldn't pair, fresh out of the box. Multiple attempts were made to get assist from Amazon Support to fix the problem, but none of the employees contacted were of any help. Upon reading the questions under this device in Amazon Support, it appears this is a known and common problem. You'd think that Amazon would've fixed it by now, but they just kept replying that they were aware of the issue and looking into it. That was at least 4 weeks ago. I have no clue why they are still selling them, when they are defective out of the box.",1
Brinna,CBS AND ABC apps DO NOT WORK,There is an obvious glitch with logging into your TV provider using both the CBS and NBC applications. Called into tech support months ago and am being told they are still working on the problem. Will not progress  to password on ABC nor NBC,1

Merrill,This will not stem Disney plus,Don’t waste your time trying to figure this all out. Disney and Amazon are in some kind of dispute so you cannot get it to stream on the device. Ironically it has a Disney plus buttonBuyers beware it will not stream and will get error code 83,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Horrible Renote!,This remote drains my batteries DAILY!! I only use this firestick for 2 hours a day and I have to change the batteries every dang day or it will not work!! If I would have known this I would have never bout this! I’ve tried cheap batteries expensive batteries and rechargeable batteries NOTHING WORKS!,1
Michael Cross,Shipping  problems,The  product is fine my fire stick came  to my house. But the television i ordered from  Amazon  at the  same  time  went  to my  neighbors house  and  was left out in the  rain. Very disappointing. And  an issue  of great  concern. I had  my reservations about this  from  the  beginning. I purchased  an extended  warranty with  the  TV and  it is  working  fine for  now. Im just  lucky  my neighbor is honest. This  could have  turned  out  badly. Lucky  for me  and  Amazon it didn't. Buying  underwear from  Amazon  is one  thing. Buying a big  ticket  item  is  another.,1
Jim,Not working after less than a year!!!,"I was very impressed at first but considering I bought less than 9 months ago and it already isn’t streaming my shows right…that’s beyond disappointing. It has quite a few streaming options, which is great. However mine has stopped showing the show/movie and it just sits on a loading screen, sometimes the sound still works but it won’t play any movies or tv shows correctly so now I have to get something else.",1
Sports Fan,Conked out in less than a Year! Extremely dissapointed with quality.,"Ordered this product just about a year ago (Nov. 2021) and worked ok. Then all of a sudden, it COMPLETELY Stopped working (10 months of use). I suggest, if you purchase that a WARRANTY is in order. Good luck. Like they say...""you get what you pay for"" just to mean, the LOW Price has no bearing on Quality.",1
Angela S.,Remote Control is Flimsy,"The firestick works just fine.  It does what it's supposed to do.My issue is the remote control.  I've bought several over the years and the most recent one I bought is noticeably different.  To be quite honest, it feels like it was made with wet paper.  Every time I press a button I'm fully expecting the remote to completely crumble.  And on top of that the price is double what it was just a few short years ago.  I'm not impressed at all.  Come on Amazon get your act together.  I remember when manufacturers and sellers used to be proud of their products.  Unfortunately we live in a different world.  The toys I had as a kid were built of better materials.  But I digress.  The fire stick works as it should, just not too sure how long the remote will last.",1
thomas powell,Nothing could make it work with my tv.,"I'm simple, but my lady is tech-savvy, and even she couldn't get it to work.  Also, there was no damn Alexa.  Didn't even have the button for voice control.",1
Dina R,Garbage,"Owned it less than a year. It resets at least once per hour. The only amazon tips on how to correct this were using the supplied power cord and plug. We are, yet this thing still resets. It works great otherwise, but having to reselect yours shows repeatedly after it takes two minutes to reset is not my idea of a good product.",1
Betty Harris,Not compatible with Disney +,"Spent an hour on the phone with Amazon tech-support installing software updates being told that we could definitely get Disney+ to load and let me login. With no success, I eventually tried to contact Disney+ and looking through their FAQs on their website, Amazon fire stick is not listed as a compatible device. There’s a button for it on the remote and there’s a picture of the Apple icon on the box all of this is very misleading!",4
ryan,Older Model More Reliable,"Needed a new remote so I upgraded to this model from the 4K model most recent before this one because it was almost just as much to just buy a new remote than a whole new fire stick.  This new model has a lot of bugs because it frequently freezes no matter what App I have streaming.  Had to unplug from the wall just to restart it.  My last fire stick had no problems.  Not very happy with this purchase.  Only difference I see is the remote has the quick buttons for Hulu, Netflix, Prime, and Disney+ which I don’t care about.",5
Mae,Shameless - screensaver turns my phone into an Amazon billboard!,"Hate that Amazon now showing ads instead of family photos for screeensaver.Don’t like ads running before prime/amazon shows.Not a fan of overall layout (but seems to have changed today) — would be nice if Amazon would remember that I turned on the ‘free to me’ setting.I’m all for commerce, but it seems to have reached a point where Amazon should pay the user of this product instead of the other way around.",3
Brian A. Hathaway,Can't connect to internet.,"If I ever get a chance to get this connected, I'll write another review, but there's a lot of frustration here.

Mark R. Wietstock,Not reliable,Have had network connectivity issues with both new 4k firesticks.  No issues with smart TVs or older sticks.  I've gone through all recommended settings and still have issues.  If you have a smart TV then don't waste your $ on firesticks.,1

I googled the issue and tried all of the suggestions. None worked. Finally I broke down and called Disney+. After 45 minutes with tech support they said since I can watch Disney+ on my computer, I’m receiving the service that I’m paying for and there’s nothing they can do to help.DO NOT buy this device if you want to watch Disney+. You will eventually be disappointed.",1
dbc00per,Broke my TV? Question mark?,"I've been using an Amazon fire stick for 3 years. I decided to upgrade this year because it had been going very slow since the major update to the interface. I still don't understand why it happened but the audio went waaaaayyy out of sync. I tried troubleshooting, resetting, restarting numerous times, and tried to manually sync the audio in settings and it still didn't work. I talked to the Amazon support team and they sent me a replacement. That did the same thing.  I tried my old decide and IT did the same thing! I never had problems with the old one for 3 years. What the heck?Anyway, TLDR; switched to Roku and it works great. The only pro I have for the Fire Stick over the Roku is that the remote is a lot slimmer and lighter, which I prefer.",1

Rita Hadeler,Just Didn't Work,"Other reviewers said that setting up this Fire TV Stick device was a breeze, but it didn't work at all for me.  After trying several things and spending 45 minutes on the phone with Amazon support (who was as helpful as he could be), it was determined that either the device was defective, or it just wasn't compatible with my older TV (although other devices connected by HDMI work fine).  My Alexa device found the firestick easily, but that was it.  Otherwise it was a brick.  Returned hassle-free for a full refund, and also got the warranty and Prime account refunded (which I only wanted/needed for this streaming device).",1
stanley phipps,Annoying!,"Works, but I HATE HATE HATE the constant barrage of previews, ads, reminders, on screen movement, etc. Very distracting when I want to do is select an App. There is no way in the settings to get rid of this advertising garbage.

Jillian Bowman,Fire stick to hit to handle,Worked ok for a while but then I go a warning that it was running hot so do not touch?  I shut it off in the middle of the movie. Waited  five minutes and turned back on and it worked fine. As the unit got older the time between warning and hot warning shortened. Now it warns after 5 minutes and if not powered off a thermometer appears showing a high temperature.  Contacted customer service and was told to turn off for three minutes and turn back on. When I responded that I had already used that method the response was thank you informing customer service.I guess the joke on me.,1

I recently bought the newest, available Firestick to control all devices and Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc.After struggling to get the Firestick to recognize the Panasonic Home Theater system, it finally recognizes it and turns it on and off with the TV. The Firestick volume control works too with the Home Theater speakers. Then in several days, the Firestick forgets the Panasonic Home Theater system and renders volume to just the TV.This has happened to me at least 4 times in the past several weeks.IT WORKS FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THEN THE FIRESTICK FORGETS THE HOME THEATER SETTINGSI cannot find out how to correct this problem so the Firestick stays controlling the TV volume as played through the Panasonic Home Theater system of speakers.",1

S.M,Worked for about a week.,It was working great for about a week then it stopped and told me to sign into the device again. So I tried and it wouldn’t let me sign into my Amazon account. I even changed the password thinking maybe someone hacked my account and it still wouldn’t let me sign into my account. My other Amazon fire sticks didn’t have that problem. I even signed onto my Amazon account with me new password so I know I got the right password. Just this fire stick won’t let me sign back on with it. Even tried to sign onto the device through the computer and it still wouldn’t let me sign on even though the computer says the device is registered.What a waste of $30. I’ll buy another streaming stick like Roku or something. No more Amazon streaming sticks for me. I’m so disappointed. Fire stick is junk.,1

Mans best friend,sec a recurring issue,"I've been using FireTV products for years and sync has been a recurring theme. However, I believed by buying these new Firesticks that the situation would at least improve. Not only is my audio and video consistently out of sync at a much higher rate (I can't watch more than 30 minutes of live TV on any app without it becoming unwatchable), but none of the fixes on Amazon or other support forums seem to provide a long term solution. I'm now stuck with a decision of overhauling all my devices to an similar device  or suffering with a far-below-par system I paid for...pathetic product in this day and age.",1
Brian S.,Failed without explanation. No support from Amazon.,"Had the 2020 4k model. Worked fine for a little over a year. Turned it on one day and the screen was just frozen on the Fire logo. Didn't respond to the remote so there was no way to reset. Did all the trouble shooting, contacted customer support and they said the warranty was up so I get nothing, just an offer for a 15% discount if I buy another one (another one I guess I'd also have to throw out after a year is up).Isn't the whole point of these devices to have something with more reliability and support than the built-in TV apps? Not to mention to waste or having to constantly replace the equipment.",1
kristy t.,Received a used product!,"Over the weekend was my first time to use my Fire TV Stick...I noticed that it must have been a used Fire Stick because of the line at the bottom of the show and then all of a sudden, it went crazy and the volume went to 100 and we could not bring it down.

Fashionfernet,Broke within a month,I bought one of these in November and it broke just before the 3 month return period.  None of the buttons worked after troubleshooting with technical support.  Amazon agreed to replace it. But that took over a month of back and forth when they finally told me to order a new one and they'd refund me upon receipt.  The power button doesn't work on the new one and I still haven't received my refund even after two separate support people told me I'd be refunded.  Would not recommend at all.,1
Brock Harris,Junk. It worked for a minute.,Yeah pretty muck a piece of junk. When it worked it was fine. Layout and menu is enough to navigate. Remote has a back button and more importantly a home button. Apple tv does not. But unfortunately this thing has a hardware or software issue which causes it to constantly cycle on and off. Rendering it pretty much useless half the time. Would I buy another FireStick 4K no.... and I can't recommend.,1
Paul Space,Lousy choice of programs,"We're a couple of senior citizens and thought we could buy this to get some programs to watch. It installed easily, and I could access the info screen with no problem. It's cluttered and full of second rate junk. We want to watch nature documentaries and I finally had to ask Alexa to find them. I found PBS nature documentaries, and then had to put in a secret code, then select the program. Then instead of playing the program, I was directed to a website where SURPRISE, I had to pledge money to PBS annually to watch their programs!! Overall, extremely disappointing, frustrating, and I returned it for a refund!!",1
DP,The remote is horrible!  Don’t buy the set with a poorly designed cheap remote.,"The remote is horrible!  The buttons don’t light up, the buttons are too small, some buttons are even black like the case and makes it near impossible to use",1
BexMDLuna,3rd not the charm.,"This is my 3rd Fire stick and the first one that’s been a problem. I hook it all up, start the install process. Screen comes up says press the play/pause button to start process.First thing it does is download updates…. Which it will not ever finish. Why ? It hasn’t connected to my wifi or the internet yet ! Let it try for an hour (in case it’s magic)… course nothing. Dig through all the troubleshooting material looking for a way to restart it maybe a way to get to wifi settings. Unplug the power cable to the Fire unit as suggested.  Get it all powered up again. Same issue. No chance to setup wifi.",1
Brian21477,Worst Streaming Device Ever,"Almost never works correctly, I have to reset it completely every time I want to use it and even that doesn’t always work. Absolute garbage device. Roku is FAR superior in every way imaginable.",1
Traveller,Firestick 4K Would Not Pair,"This is the 5th Firestick 4K my family has purchased from Amazon in the past month that absolutely none of them would pair with remote.  Every possibility of suggestions to pair did not work.  I am experienced in working with the Firesticks and first time I have had this problem. The Firestick is a wonderful product that we get a lot of enjoyment out of.  This pairing problem is the first problem but to have it happen to 5 different items shipped to 2 different family households, I would hope this problem would be corrected soon.",1
Anne M. Supik,Frustrating… definitely NOT “plug and play”,"I’ve never had a problem with fire tvs, but the firestick 4k setup is a joke. It won’t pair with the remote no matter what I do: Remove the included batteries, try other batteries, unplug, hold the home button, hold the left+menu+back buttons. I tried all of the above on a second TV, same outcome. The included instructions don’t have any troubleshooting either, this was all info from the firetv website and google. I even downloaded the firetv app but guess what? It only works once the original remote is paired.",1
Merrill,This Is The Worst Free & Live TV,"After the Ian Hurricane, it could not be used to pick up my WiFi, amazon, or even if I tried to input the info on the TV with all the info. That is, username and password. I did this for 3days and nothing worked!!",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Worst Customer Service Ever,"Had an older Fire TV Stick and wanted to turn my TV on and off with a voice command. After 6 hours with customer service they said my device was defective, recommended I buy a new one. When the new device did not work I was told that a voice command would NOT turn on the TV. I was also not told that their would be a return fee. Incompetence to the point of being fraudulent. They should have known right away that it was not possible but it cost me time and money.",5
P.Silvey,Don’t buy it !! No customer service if broken,My red box app didn’t  work when I received it and I sent 30 messages to customer service and no one will get back to me and basically I got stiffed with  a broken fire stick payed 90. For nothing,3
KPatriotH,Bad,"New version has connection issues, I just so happened to have gotten one. Worst part is that it's a known issue and Amazon doesn't make it known. You'll have to do you r own research only to end up back at tech support, lol.",1
Brad Morris,Wouldn't connect,"Unfortunately, I couldn't get this to connect to my TV no matter what I did.  The logo would flash for a moment, then the screen would just stay black.  I watched several trouble shooting videos and nothing worked.  I spent a couple of hours, unplugging this and then, reconnecting here, trying different HDMI ports, nothing.  Really upsetting.",1
Mandi G,The remote is not fully functional.  It only worked for about a week.,The remote is already not working and we will need to replace it.  Only the power and the volumn buttons work.  We have to use our Alexa to view anything.  We are not happy with this remote.,1
Chris T.,Can't rate shows or movies,Amazon will not let you rate shows or movies from the stick itself.  You see movies that has 4 or 5 start when it's really a 0.  Called customer service on this and the only way to rate it to go to your app on your phone or whatever.  Just a way for Amazon to push movies or shows that wouldn't even interest you.  Sure just for some dollars. Another way for corporations pushing agendas onto you and keeping your voice out. Small thing but still.,1
Anonymous,Graphic Artifacting Constantly,"I have tried every different ""fix"" for this and know my TV is compatible with this device and yet everytime I turn on the Fire Stick I get small static artifacting all over the screen, I have found a small ""fix"" that works momentarily if I go into the firestick display settings and change the screen resolution but as soon as I go tot turn the firestick back on later the artifacting is back again and I have to do this every time I have tried to use it.",1
Neal K.,Garbage,"Absolute garbage, replaced several old models with the new models and every stick has a different bug, Amazon quality is at a new low",1
Kenneth J Siranko,Do not buy if you use Hulu.,"Does not work with Hulu.  When viewing Hulu live TV on the my fire stick the experience becomes entirely aggravating in a hurry.  I experience consistent buffering, freezing, degraded picture quality, and it will suddenly go to the main home screen. I am not sure why Amazon cannot figure how to fix this.  Amazon will blame it on my WiFi and internet speeds, but I have no problems when I stream Hulu directly to my TV or when I watch anything else using the fire stick.  The problem seems specific to Hulu and the fire stick.",1
AJ,Updates rendered this thing almost useless,"Update ruined usability. ""Freevee"" and prime video now take up so much space that you cannot install other apps. I've had to go back to the Chromecast for hulu/Netflix etc...Edit: A new update was pushed that fixed the issues completely. Fairly quick turnaround on fixing the original update that shouldn't have been released into the wild in the first place. 🙄",1
Cha,Junk,"Often just doesn't record. a few times the unit has to to rebooted from a dead state.  Unable to dlete multiple shows in a series, you have to go to each one and delete.  Overall poorly planned and laid out software.  Very undependable and frustrating.",1
Merrill,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,Have no idea why this is tied into Prime subscription.About 10 old movies are FREE the rest you pay for like any other streaming service.I guess Bezos needs the money for the MEGA Yacht.To bad I'm past the return date or I would send this piece of junk back.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Started showing lines on screen,"Like 1/4 of the screen is like a frame behind and you can see it, I’ve contacted amazon like 3 times already and they haven’t fixed it nor replaced it, it started like a month after i got it and i couldn’t return it, can’t even enjoy watching tv cause it’s so noticeable",1
Mom,Think I'm going with Roku next time..,"The fire stick is not really all that great.  Some of the apps are very lagged and Amazon loves mixing in your subscription movie titles with ""extra"" movies you click on in your subscription app like Stars for example and come to find out it's a movie not in your subscription list they want you to pay extra for.  Just a scum / scam type system.  The voice remote lags terribly and once the device is around a year or two old.... Forget it.. you need a new one.",4
Phillip A Roberts,Faulty Firestick,"I have to return this Firestick as it is faulty / we tried resetting, but Geek Squad tried to get it to work, but turns out to be a faulty firestick",5
conrad,Not as good as Roku,My smart tvs and the portal through my cable company and the Roku all work the same way. This Fire stick has different menus in the streaming services which are nothing like the others. It buffers much more then the others. This Fire stick went into a drawer and I went back to a new Roku. Much better.,3
Jim,This Thing is worthless,If you want to reconnect all the time there is a bad  connection or Alexa can not find CBS Channel 3 and want to miss part of the show then this is for you for me this thing is worthless,1
Ree,Expect the stick to last 2 years,"This is my 3rd fire stick. All 3 stop working, will just keep looking like it's loading.  Got 2 years out of this last one. Amazon won't refund for sticks past a year. Fed up with Amazon. My whole house is amazon and I greatly regret not going with a different smart home.",1
Sheron Johnson,System is getting worse not better,Since they started connect other rf devices to the network the whole thing has started going down hill. Music stops unexpectedly or turns down  on its own.  There is always a connection issue and needs restarting.,1
Cristina,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,I bought three fire sticks because a friend recommended them and two of them don't work at all. The first would not work out of the box and the second quit working randomly three months later. I went through all of the trouble shooting with Amazon and they could not get it to work. They wouldn't give me a refund either. Will definitely never buy these again. Sticking with what works...the Roku.,1

NVDarkfrog,Dead on arrival.,"Set up and connected to my network without any trouble other than the fact that it was extremely slow right out of the box, then hit the back button one time on the sign in to amazon account screen and now the whole thing is permanantly broken. It now turns on saying it is checking for updates and the network conection is slower than normal every time and freezes in a permanant dead screen until unplugged. It is compelely nonresponsive to the remote once it gets to the downloading screen and can not be fsctory reset or altered in any way. Amazon was unable to assist, had to return.",1
A. Peterson,Streaming and voice work perfectly but.....,This is my 2nd firestick but first Firestick 4k.. everything was working perfectly until we phone screened a movie to the TV.  Ever since then the firestick will only display a black screen. After a month of not messing with it. We tried it one more time and it started working for only 5days.. now its back to a black screen. We have tried troubleshooting it and nothing works.,1
Merrill,A lot of buffering,I should have bought the 4 max.  There are too many streaming/ buffering interruptions when the stick is in use.  We have roughly 500 Mbps and the streaming interruptions just shouldn’t happen.  I wish we could send it back.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,PISS poor Amazon Services when it comes to an AMAZON PRODUCT,"Have never experienced having trouble returning other items on Amazon.

John Cowsert,Product doesn't match photos,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Update: I've been sold a dud. Can't get past the initial fire tv logo. Goes to a blank screen and nothing happens (see attached video). For reference my older FireTV is connected to the same TV without issue. I've tried this new FireTV in the same HDMI port and on the ports of other TVs and still nada. Also tried solutions via Google. Wasted money as I'm not in the US anymore. One star.I ordered the fire tv stick 4k due to the photos indicating that the remote came with buttons for Netflix, Disney+, etc. However as seen from my photo, it's just the normal remote. For that I'm giving it 2 stars for the deception.",1
gladeplugin787,The remote does not work unless I take the batteries out and put them back in,"I never had this problem with my previous Fire Stick remote, but there is something wrong with this one. EVERY time I want to use it, including changing a station, I have to take the batteries out and put them back in.  EVERY TIME!!! The batteries aren't dead, because they work in other appliances, but this remote is just jacked up.  I looked for help, there is none. This remote is the very worst part of my purchase, otherwise the streaming is great.",1
Donna Dyson-Horn,Slow Streamer,"I replaced my 1st Generation Fire TV with a trade in.  I am disappointed to say the least since the newer one is a 4 K, but it is slow as hell. Some apps do not seem to work smoothly as my previous 1st Generation Fire TV.  I would not buy it again and would recommend to keep the 1st Generation if you have one.",4
Brick house ,All fire sticks are,I plugged this thing and started it up it updated twice I'm not even sure how it connected to the internet cuz I never put a password or even try to connect it to the internet and then it goes on to a page to activate it with like these digits and then the page went blank and I couldn't see nothing the stick just went blank on the TV I don't know what the heck matter with it. So I restarted it and now it just says internet's too slow check your modem it does that every time. I am over it so I took a hammer to it and smashed it into a million pieces I will use TiVo stream 4K from now on those things are awesome fire sticks are junk,5
karen dougherty,Intermittent connection issues,"Intermittent connection issues. There are other wifi devices connected to the same tv that don’t have any issues (Apple TV, chromecast).",3
Chris S,Garbage. Don’t bother,This is garbage and I’m really sad that Amazon is even continuing to sell it. We have had ours for less than a year and have continued to have problems with it. It decides to randomly shut off while you are watching or fails to connect to any apps (not internet because other devices would work just fine) and every time I tried to contact Amazon to just get a replacement they would tell me it needs to be factory reset and then it would work. If I have to factory reset a device multiple times a week it’s obviously defective. Don’t waste your money. Go Apple TV or Roku and save yourself the annoyance.,1
Felix,Remote died within a couple months,The remote is piece of garbage. Completely dead after battery changes and numerous reset/pair attempts. Now I have to look for a replacement remote which they look to cost pretty much the same as the whole fire stick. Crap product,1
Francisco,NOT A REPLICA OF INSIGNIA REMOTE CONTROL!,See Alexa MICROPHONE on left Remote?  Nonexistent on replacement I purchased. I can't use verbal commands with new one. Must return it!,1
Jessica Campbell,Extremely Disappointed,"A couple months ago, I decided to upgrade from my Fire Stick Cube to a newer 4k. The biggest mistake ever. I'm on my 3rd 4k Fire Stick and all 3 were defective, the last 2 the remote was glitchy, pic freezes and this last one, right out the box the remote wouldn't pair.. after 2 calls with the most patient tech support rep. we got it working and the next day the volume stopped working. Amazon has been great about exchanges & refunds but who wants to deal that? I'm going to return it and go back to my faithful Cube. The picture clarity wasn't quite the same as the 4k but it's still worth going back too and avoid the ""Junk"" Amazon's spitting out and I'm still using my 1st - 2nd Gen stick with no problems. I'm Done!",1
F pickels,Received Defective,This product does not work.  Spent time with tech support they could not fix it.  They offered a replacement but told me I could not do same day delivery when the item I ordered and received came the same day.  Bottom line totally waste of time.  They were useless!,1
Merrill,youtube tv will not connect,"If you purchase a Firestick, you will eventually run into a blank screen when trying to connect to Youtube tv.I have two Firesticks and both will just blank out when choosing to connect to Youtube. Sometimes HBOMax will not connect. I have 200 meg download speed and one device so the internet is not the problem. Get a ROKU.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Lots of undesirable issues,Returned it because I had to keep rebooting my equipment to get it to work for just a few minutes at a time.,1
C. W. Lorance,Won’t connect to Alexa,"The remote is very flimsy and keeps saying batteries are extremely low no matter how many brand new mixed manufacturer batteries I install.  Have tried several times to get it to connect with my Alexa, including step by step YouTube videos, the whole reason I bought it, or can’t connect or not recognized.  Moved the unit to a spare room and went back to my ROKU.  For the cost of the damn $140 yearly membership, they ought to throw one in.",1
An Amazon Customer,Make sure to set it up right away,"I bought this as a christmas gift, didn't end up giving it away. I got some Amazon email that I was running out of time to set it up about a month ago. Finally got it out and tried to set it up today, now it just hangs on ""downloading the latest software"" forever. I've tried multiple factory resets, different power adapters, different TVs. Incredibly frustrating.I don't know if Amazon disabled it because it wasn't used or if it was just dead on arrival and I didn't find out til now, but either way I don't have the option to return it so waste of money either way.",1
GE Baker,Didn't work a month,The fire stick worked fine for a few days.  Then it stopped.  I have tried all of the trouble shooting tips.  I guess that I will have to send it back.,1
Daron Shiflet,Only lasted 5 months and can’t return.,This was my second time purchasing a fire stick. I was told from customer service to purchase this fire stick because I had problems with the first remote control. This remote control only lasted 5 months and now I have to purchase another fire stick because I can’t use this remote.,4
Wriggs,Stopped working less than a week after the return period,"Less than a week after the return period, the only application that would actually load is the amazon video application. It worked just fine before then but there were no updates available meaning that everything was up to date and even after giving it a few days to see if an update would come, nothing. It's a useless device at this point. Be careful.",5
Lynn S.,Remote stopped working within 6 months,"I am very good at figuring out tech and have reprogrammed many remotes as well as previous Firestick remotes. The remote that came with this new Firestick stopped working and will not respond to new batteries or re-programming.

rmantia,Buttons on the remote quit working,"Buttons on the remote quit working the speak option has never worked on one of them and issues with it freezing up, leaving no choice other than unplugging the device.  now not even a year after having it one of them doesn’t work at all. Can’t seem to get Amazon to help me with it either",1
Stamper Pete,The remote can’t sync whatsoever,"The remote doesn’t work. Wouldn’t sync to the firestick & tried syncing it to another remote to later replace it with this one; didn’t work either.  Used the batteries received, new batteries, had the remote touching the system, backed up & even had someone else assist to see if they could make it work to no avail.",1
Angie Millman,A piece of crap,Absolutely hate this piece of crap. Our cable company foisted this off on us and it is a GIANT leap backwards. Way too many times it just sits there and buffers and buffers or we get a message that there’s a problem. Stay as far away from Amazon’s Fire Stick as you can for as long as you can.,1
Tony,Doesn't Pair,"Very disappointed. We had a first gen of the fire stick for 5 years and it finally stopped working. Bought this to replace it and the remote won't pair. Worthless at this point. My husband and I are tech savvy and still couldn't get it to pair. The ""forums"" for this issue do not help. We tried all of the suggestions and do nothing.  Whoever from Amazon answers the questions on the forum are not helpful they just send you back to the same try this and try that.  Very disappointed.",1
Merrill,WILL NOT PAIR TO THE REMOTE,"i cannot even give this product a one star ratting because i purchased two of the 4k firesticks and neither one would pair with it's remote,thus rendering them useless. I have three other firesticks that are not 4k in various rooms and they work flawlessly. Needless to say I returned the two 4k firesticks to Amazon and will be purchasing two of the non 4k firesticks like we now have and are using.  PS i was forced to give this a star rating to submit my review.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Do Not Buy,I have purchased two 4k Fire Sticks. The first one would go to the “black screen of death” about once a week. It seemed to take 1 or 2 days to reset and then work. The Amazon support advice of resetting the device as well as doing the hard forced factory reset worked sometimes. But usually waiting 1 or 2 days and logging back in would work. So I purchased another one. This one died on the second day. The Amazon logo comes up and then when it flashes off the tv screen stays black. No matter what I did to rest the black screen remains. Sent this one back too. Thank goodness I have a Rocky stick.,1
Chelsey Miller,Battery draining garbage updated fire stick,"Absolutely awful product, this version of the fire stick has a serious battery-draining issue ( this is noted on multiple internet reviews and threads). I’VE  LITERALLY SPENT MORE MONEY ON BATTERIES THAN THE PRODUCT ITSELF! I am amazed that Amazon hasn’t fixed this problem",1
Lisa Parent,Broke one month out of warranty,"Starting just one month after the warranty expired the fire stick stop working (wouldn't load beyond the logo). Called Amazon support and the guy walked me through various trouble shooting steps and said he needed to escalate it and call me back the following day. When he didn't call me back, I called back myself and they didn't have a record of my conversation the day before. Ended up trouble shooting all over again only for them to conclude it was beyond help and all they could offer me was a 15% discount on a new firestick. That was the extent of their goodwill. Surely the design life of these products is greater than 1 month beyond their warranty.",1
Brett,Poor quality,I have used fire sticks for a few years but now using a different system. Fire sticks do not last long. The price is cheap but so is the quality. Spend a little more once and get a better system. I like Amazon but not Fire Sticks!,1
Zombie Zelda,Full of ads unrelated to video content.,"Perhaps Amazon thinks I bought the ""Fire TV stick with special offers"" the way people can  do with the Kindle. I didn't. Nor did I get the product at a discount for agreeing to see ads as a screensaver. Amazon was specific about screen saver categories.Amazon has gone from showing the screen saver I selected to showing ads COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO VIDEO CONTENT.  I did not sign up for this.They have turned my TV onto a billboard without my permission. They explicitly told me that I could use the device to display my own photos from a library, not ads for a Hyundai. And I don't see how a McDonald's ad on the main screen is supposed to help me in a video device.",1
Kindle Customer,2 units failed in less than 3 months,"Bought 2 of these for 2 different TVs in my house.  The first ones remote died about a week ago, a replacement is almost the cos of a brand new one.  Second one just will not get past the initial load.  Im sure they will bury this review but do yourself a favor and just spend a little extra on a roku.",1
J.L.,"Amazon Support Said this would be Dolby Atmos with Prime Video, but they LIED!","Both Amazon Support and the Product Descriptions on the Box and Amazon Website claim that this will use Dolby Atmos with UHD content such as Jack Ryan (Season 1). However, there leave out that you must have a 4k TV or the Prime Video app on the Fire Stick 4K will not allow Atmos even if you have a compatible Atmos device.This is so stupid since an Audio format like Atmos has nothing to do with the Video resolution!Cheap and sloppy development and unacceptable support since this issue is a known issue on Amazon forums since 2018!",4

Rob,FIRESTICK STOPPED WORKING AFTER 4 MONTHS,I BOUGHT A FIRESTICK FOR MY SPARE ROOM FOUR MONTHS AGO.  PROBABLY USED IT A DOZEN TIMES.  SUDDENLY IT STOPPED WORKING.  CAN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT TOO LONG.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.,1
Vanessa Rosas,Impossible to open fire tv stick remote to insert batteries,I have seen numerous complaints from individuals who are unable to open the remote to insert the batteries.  I have decades of experience with expensive as well as cheap electronics.  Never had a situation before where I could not open the battery compartment of a remote to insert the batteries.  Please redesign the remote.  Had to return the product just because of the remote.  Thanks.,1
Merrill,Does not function right,Freezes up and sound does not stay constant level. Freezes up and have to power cycle. Be watching hulu and kicks back out to home screen. This is starting to be annoying. I would not recommend this model. Have to clear cache all the time and it only allows app. Chat with support and got no where. Problem is storage not enough to stream with a lot of apps installed update research on line and this is a known issue. Found if wired to ethernet connection the firestick works fine it been several days and no problem. Not sure why wifi had issues since it had a strong signal.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Remote was designed by an idiot.,"We have lots and lots of battery powered products and lots of remotes too. I can easily replace the batteries in every one of those devices. But not the batteries in the Fire TV Stick remote.  If you put your thumbnail in the tiny depression behind the arrow and push hard while pulling then you might get the cover off. Nothing should have to be that difficult to replace batteries. I will probably take my Dremel and cut a slot though the cover to make it easier. What do the people at Amazon have on their fingers, glue?",1
Mike ,Horrible Device !!!!!,"Bought one of these, set it up, for our poolside tv, first night worked beautiful..... second day remote stopped working. Went thru procedure multiple times and could not get remote to work. Tech support sent another one. Again set it up, first night worked great. Brought remote in the house thinking maybe the daytime heat was affecting it and the same thing. Second day remote stopped working. Not worth the aggravation.",1

Chancy Spencer,Quality on the fire sticks has degraded,"I bought this as a replacement to another fire stick that had started having issues with its remote.  It wouldn't recognize the remote and the remote was burning through the batteries.  This fire stick almost immediately started having the same issues.  We replaced batteries and we ran through the recommended tech support.  Any fixes only lasted a little while.  Yesterday, the remote stopped working altogether.  The fire stick was right about 30 days old from delivery date so I requested a replacement through Amazon support (a circuitous painful process).  Amazon customer support refused unless I went through tech support again first.  I could however get a refund (?) and so I did.  I'm going back to Roku.",1
The House,Waste of money and time,"Just bought it to finally give it a try since I always had Roku. Made a big mistake. Just received  my firestick and it doesn't work.

Jd M.,Not loyal to Amazon anymore!!!,"I ordered a Firestick... it's wasn't working. Sent me a replacement in Feb, but just tried using it and it doesn't work. I have 3 other tvs with firestick, so know how to use it. Called and told me I was out of the return window. They sent me a broke one and wouldn't do anything.  I've been loyal to AMAZON for years. Gonna find a different streaming device and definitely not ordering anything unless I don't have an option. I know they don't give a crap, but they'll lose way more than the cost of a Firestick over this. So ridiculous. Total BS!!!!!",1
Dena Hodges,Needs new batteries every day!!,I upgraded to the newer version of the Firestick with high hopes it would be as great as my older verision. Unfortunately the remote drains the batteries every day. I went and bought brand new batteries to make sure the ones I had on hang weren't the problem. Be prepared to buy stock in batteries if you want to be able to use the remote. I guess I should have kept the older version.,4
cokemom56,DISGUSTING 🤢!! Sometimes it works other times you need to unplug it,These new firestick are good but flawed.. I regularly have to unplug it be a use I would get static on the input... The stick would randomly reset and then the static on screen.. The only way to resolve it is to unplug power cable and reconnect.. This is the only one to do it. Mthe older models didn't and don't have this issue... Sadly it happens after two months so it is past the return windows... Disgusting,5
Steve,Meh,"It's an ok product. Barely lasted half a year before it stopped working and It's my second fire stick. i hoped that the second one would work better but no. And of course they stopped working AFTER the exchange deadline. Ok product, but purchase with caution.",3
oscar garcia,Worse Smart TV stick ever!,"Amazon refused to refund my money despite having spent two hours with their absolutely loved ineffective tech support and still the stick was buffering and on its own turning off, etc. Sad that after being a loyal Amazon customer that they didn’t stand behind their own product. I ended up putting it in a drawer and ordered a Roku stick.",1
Merrill,Keeps restarting,"Every single day multiple times a day, both new firesticks will randomly shut off and reboot. Doesn't matter if live streaming or movies...

Mike ,Too Busy,"I don't like the unit. It seems like everything that's supposed to be FREE to watch is asking me to sign up, or register. I don't get it. It's NOT what I thought it would be. I might fiddle with it some more, but I'm hooking my Over The Air TV Antenna back up. I can get right at 30 channels with the good old antenna. I was hoping to be able to enjoy some special programing with the Fire Stick. Not ESPN, HBO or the other popular pay channels. I get that. I'll likely pitch it and call it a swing and a miss.",1
Derick Moore,Will not pair.,Can't use because it will not pair . I have a fire device on 6 of 7 of my tvs. This fire stick 4 k  must be the lucky junk one it will not pair ..  I can't even get it to the settings with my phone remote. Junk wasted my time only got this one because my older one keeps rebooting  I was hoping firedticks got better not worse..,1
Fox,Remote Didn’t work,"While the fire stick is great, the remote it came with was broken.  Went through  10 batteries and kept telling us battery was low.  Had to be standing directly next to the fire stick to get it to work.",1
Cheri Clifton,Always a problem with this device,"I bought it for watching prime video and some news channels.  I cannot complete a show without it dropping it. I did factory reset. It lasts a few hours and acts up again. It blames it on internet connection, my connection is 51.8 mbps. My desktop is on the same location.I am sorry I ever bought this stick. Fortunately my fire tv in the other room works fine.",1
A Prime Customer in LA,Amazon really dropped the ball on this.  This is the second one that hasn't worked,We bought a Firestick that worked initially then quit.  Amazon had us order another one (an enhanced version) which arrived today and we can't even get it past the remote pairing feature.  Amazon really dropped the ball on the Firestick product overall. We will be returning.,1
Kevin M.,"So hard to set up, and assistance did not work","I'm so disappointed in how hard this is to set up.  I don't know if it is something about my older smart TV that is confusing it, but pressing home with nice batteries and everything plugged in is not working at all.  I'm going to return this product and try Chromecast.",1
fernando l.,Buy lots of batteries!,"Bought this for our deck tv since it was reasonably priced compared to the Apple TV (which I have in every room of the house already). Used it 4 different times about 1-3 days apart, and each time needed to replace the batteries. Apparently that is the norm with these new generation controllers. Returned it for a ROKU stick. Fingers crossed!",1
Rebecca,That it actually work,Connected device and remote will not pair. Could not setup and was unusable. Contacted support and they were no help. They just said would send a new remote and it would take a week to arrive. A brand new device useless for a week with the hope a new remote will fix it.,1
Christian Y,"ordered 3, 1 didn't work","Contacted support and they deactivated the wrong one. Now I have 2 out of three that do not work, what a pain.",4
J D Simone,Does Not Work,Bought 3 in total and all did not work. Setup process would end @ an error message saying it was unable to load updates. tried on 4 different tvs and different wifi connections. talked to amazon support and they couldn’t find a fix or youtube. bought a new one from best buy and works flawlessly. will be retuning the 3.,5
Merrill,Old tech + nonglobal access.,"Old tech + nonglobal access. I'm from Houston Texas but I work in Goma DR Congo.  I stream  and buy a lot of movies on my iPOD, other streaming apps using my TV and cell phone. I find that  Amazon Prime is very limiting and Its not global. 👎  My smart TV came with more apps than this fire stick plus I have the same apps on my phone and iPod.  I thought this fire stick was supposed to be the greatest thing, but its not.  I don't need a remote that I can talk to.  I need entertainment.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Dead on arrival,Would not work! Tried to pair it as instructed but nothing ever happened. After following several troubleshooting instructions just decided to return it and get a refund. Severely disappointed,1
seabreez,This thing sucks!,I hate the fact that it doesn't work properly and you can't get any customer service. Bunch of foreigners that can't even speak English!!!  I'm done with Amazon,1
les,No good,"If you have a home theater with an audio receiver and full surround sound, do not purchase this item.  It will not work at all unless it is plugged directly into the TV.  If you try to use your HDMI input on the receiver and then send the output signal to the TV this item will not work.I don’t know why they would design this item this way.  I even contacted Amazon tech support and they told me it would not work for my application.",1
TP,Stuck on fire stick logo .waited over hour and half and no response from customer service,Fire stick stuck on logo . Contacted Amazon customer service. First rep put me on hold for 30 minutes and disconnected the call. Called second time the guy out me on hold for an hour . Called in 3 time and got the second rep and he was saying I am sorry for wait and was asking what all did I try . I already explained him first time what all things I tried . This is the first time I am experiencing such a bad customer service from Amazon,1
Mary Anna Replogle,Poor performance after upgrades,"When the firesticks are first released they work fairly well, than the system updates come which eat away at the performance until the stick is almost useless because of how slow the interface is to respond.  Amazon has now made it impossible to downgrade the Firesticks to previous versions by adding eFuses to the circuitry, so you can't even flash back to a previous version.  My firestick after the last update now struggles to even run Pandora, and forget about it running Plex or anything that will take up more resources like that.  I feel like the Firesticks are put out there to get you to eventually buy the Fire Cubes which have far better performance.",1
Hillbilly Acres,Fire stick,This fire stick would not connect with usb.  I would have sent it back but my son accidentally tore the box complexly up.  I have had bad luck with the Firestick someone said to use Romi instead.,1
Xander,No support,I have 7 4k fire sticks  in my home. All of these work fine but my latest one. It buffers all the time. Even if I place it in an area where a different firestick works fine it still buffers. I didn’t buy it from Amazon and the store I bought it from won’t let me exchange it. This is very frustrating considering the amount of money I have spent on these. Over 350 dollars,1
JMY,Want to know how little Amazon thinks of you?  Watch this AD to find out!,"Ads, ads, ads, ads, ads.You're not buying a product.  You ARE the product.There's no way to stop it.  I went into all of the settings and attempted to purge these annoyances like I was exorcising a demon from my TV and had zero luck.  Don't be fooled by the ""go into xyz setting and select no"" talk.  It will still pump out ads to you at every turn.Turn on the device?  Hope you like an ad.Use an app?  Hope you like an ad.Press PAUSE!  Here, open wide, here comes another AD.It's insulting.",1
D,Not happy.,Paid all that money never got it to work.  Bought extra remote because they said that was what I needed still did not work.,1
Mathew S.,No Wall power source,"Unfortunately I didn’t set up my fire stick as soon as I got it due to unforeseen issues, but who knew it had to be plugged into a power source. I’d have to run an extension cord in order to do so. Now I have a stick I can’t use unless I use it in my kitchen and purchase a new television for. I wish I knew it couldn’t keep a charge.",1
LB8013,Remote died,The streaming access was not good even if modem was relocated to neat unit. Remote died in 4 weeks,4
Merrill,THE DEVICE COULD NOT POWER UP,"I bought this Firestick and tried to add it to my television set(this was not the first one I bought and added) I realise it was not powering up so I changed the power cord, still nothing, then I tried resetting the remote and to link it with the firestick, still nothing. I used another firestick I had and it came up promptly.The firestick is not functioning.",5
Mark R. Wietstock,"3 ordered, 3 broken.","Absolutely worthless. I’ve ordered 3 Fire sticks and all 3 have broken within 6 months. The remote is cheap hollow plastic and the device itself freezes and lags so often that it becomes unusable until it finally decides to stop functioning entirely. I’ve given it 3 chances, hoping maybe I just had dumb bad luck and all 3 have failed. Do not buy this product. There are much better options out there.",3
felisha n.,"Junk, turns off after 5 minutes and restarts",Actually doesn’t work for more than 5 minutes before it powers off and restarts.  This is my third fire stick and it is horrible. Did not have this problem with other versions,1
Kevin,We purchased for streaming,"We purchased this Fire Stick for streaming, however it would not allow us to download the necessary apps for streaming. We'd like to return this item however the window of opportunity has closed... so upsetting!",1
Amazon Customer,Failed after 6 months,"Bought this Firestick to replace one that froze after several years use.  This one only made it roughly six months and is dead.  Every time I go to restart it, the Fire TV logo pops up, followed by a quick glitch and it then sits on a black screen.  Disappointing...",1
Heather M,Reboots,This thing reboots every 20 minutes.  If I had know that I would have never bought it and just stuck with the smart TV system,1
David L.,Not worth it- won’t connect to streaming services,"Don’t get this, compared to past fire sticks there is something wrong with this one. Issues with color saturation which you notice right away, but soon you’ll notice increasingly frequent problems where apps shut down and say “oops something went wrong” and can’t connect to wifi even though it is strong and other devices can. It’s gotten so Fremont that it’s not a matter of if hbo max or Hulu will stop working, but when. Then today for the first time the tv turns on but the screen just stays black",1
Marine2111,Remote control and system processes problems.,"The control lacks so many helpful features. A last button, a mute button, a guide button, numbers to enter channels to mention a few. Instead it calls for the user to drill down for results. We are completely dissatisfied with the functions as I am sure other users are. The question is why did Comporium move to this? What can Comporium do to get customers back to at least what we previously had?",1
Nathan Jacob Miller,Remote died already.,Great until the remote died.  Fell back to the fire stick purchased in 2016.,1
Gareth Kennedy,Doesn’t Work,We are an Amazon family.Recently moved my dad in and bought this for his room.Didn’t work straight out of the box.So disappointed.To do a replacement- what a hassle.Now it’s coming in 2 shipments.I don’t understand why I can order it togetherIt doesn’t work so now the new will take 2 shipments a week apart. 🙄I think I am more disappointed with the return/replacement process than it not working,1
Nancy Hunt,Defective NOT UPDATING. Unable to accept Amazon account information,Bought this product in November 2021. Decided to replace my current fire stick with this version in 2022. Very disappointed with the outcome. The fire stick is not updating and is not accepting my Amazon account information. New brand and it’s not working. I tried all the issue correction videos on google and it still doesn’t work. Disappointed purchase!,1
Wayne,4k New Firestick,"Received a faulty firestick/remote. The firestick could not find the remote. After trying several times, starting and rebooting and unplugging and trying, it just couldn't find the remote. Returned to Amazon for a refund. Bad batch of Firesticks because my friend experienced the exact same issue.",1
Merrill,Slow AF,You have about 4-6 months for it's processor to give up and you're forced to buy it again. It becomes unbearably slow.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Does not work,My unit did not work. Connected it to 3 separate devices. I missed my return window so I tried to get a replacement. That was difficult and a complete waste of time. I'm not getting the replacement from customer service  😒,5
Matthew M. Maskey,this device does not work.,I can't even get my money back. I've been trying to fix this stupid thing for months now with no success its going in the trash and it's the last I will purchase this device. Thanks for no help Amazon.,3
RPC,Amazon has blocked modifying the Main Page and is planning on blocking apps from outside of Amazon.,I bought this Fire Stick only to be able to adapt the Main Page ( I have an older one). Amazon blocked this. One star only.,1
juan corral,Remote has never worked correct,Remote has never worked correctly. I have tried all the standard things to reset and reprogram and tried to connect old remotes. Not sure if it’s the device or the remote. I loved my last fire stick but have had no luck with this one,1
Aaron beeston,Very poor performance compared to roku,"We have been using a roku and had to switch to firetv because one of the apps stopped updating on roku. So we thought this would be as easy to use as roku but were dissappointed, its very pathetic. Very slow, lots of glitches, stops working periodically and then we have to restart. Overall very bad experience would not recommend.",1
Maria Gonzalez,Does not work for my new Sony tv,After installing unit when turned on the screen menu appears but it is freezes. I Have to play with the tv remote and then the  fire stick unit until I eventually get to either Amazon video or Netflix and then exit the program to eventually get to direct tv stream. Very frustrating. Unfortunately when I decided that i had enough and was going to return unit big snow storm hit and I could not get out to return with my return window ending a day.  My other two fire sticks work just fine.,1
Jam Rock,Amazon Apps can't remove but told I don't have any space left,"I keep getting error messages that I am out of memory.  I just have a few apps that I added.  It will not let me remove Amazon Silk Browser, Amazon IMDb, Amazon FireTV Player, Amazon Live Shopping, Amazon Music, Amazon App Store, Amazon Kids, Amazon Photos and Amazon Alexa Shopping.  I have only a few apps that I installed like YouTube and Spotify.  This is rediculous.  Bad Amazon bad.  Shame on you.",1
GEO,Did not work. Had to return it.,"I was not able to pass the ""update fire stick screen"". People from Amazon was kind and provide fast responses, but at the end I returned it.",1
S. A. ROBBINS,Horrible experience,"The picture was absolutely crappy. I bought it on sale, ask for replacement told me that they were going to credit my account instead. So I had to order a plain one not 4K that was more expensive but the picture signal is clear as a bell",1
Anthony,Freezes all the time and doesn't hold a connection,"We got 2 of these and have the same problem with both.  They freeze and you have to reset it.  In addition a lot of features on our cable system don't work with these.  For example you can't set favorite channels.  It's cheap compared to cable boxes but is far from perfect.To be fair, the problem surfaces primarily (perhaps exclusively) when the fire stick is used as a tuner for xfinity cable.  It is most likely related to the software.",1
Kelsey & Dan,Danger! some remotes defective!,"I have to replace the aaa batteries daily. For some reason, this remote drains the entirety of 2 aaa batteries everyday. I think it’s defective but Amazon is making it difficult to replace. Only return. Very frustrating",1
Merrill,Wouldn’t buy again,"The storage is a constant problem. I only have 1 app on the fire stick, and every day it says I have critically low storage. Everyday I have to clear cache from the same Amazon apps that I can’t delete and don’t need just to watch the 1 app I want. I’m not happy with the purchase at all.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,It's not worth the money.,The product works sporadically and in short is not worth the hassle.,1
A.G,DO NOT USE FIRE STICK,"This product keeps freezing, rebooting by itself and just goes back to home screen. Chatted with customer service and had me jumping through hoops like a trained monkey only to have the same issues. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!! All my fire sticks do the same thing. I have gig internet and have no issues with any other device I have.",1
Amazon Customer,Why can’t I access my purchases I spent,"I spent hundreds of dollars on videos which should appear in my stuff, and they don’t.",4
EDWIN,Voice input stopped working,"The voice input on the remote stopped working at some point.Even after trying every solution suggested on the internet (de-registering the Fire Stick with Amazon, then re-registering; resetting the remote-to-stick connection through power-cycling both; etc), it still does not work.Having owned two of these and a Fire tablet, I have come to expect that Amazon electronic products will exhibit beta test quality.",5
Matthew Joyner,Mary,I am disappointed with this product. The quality is very bad and I want to know if I can return this and take the refund.,3
amber1567,Disappointing  video quality ☹️,"I ordered this 4K Fire stick to replace my old Big Fire TV device. Great that Amazon delivered on the same day which is nice, however the video streaming quality was abysmal compared to my old Fire tv device. It is way too blurry and dark. YouTube froze many times which never happened before with my old Fire tv.Now went back afain to my old device. Never expected this from Amazon.",1
Jimmy,Forced Upgrade Like Apple,"I see Amazon is playing the same game that Apple got in trouble for by force bricking older models. This has happened with too many different models over the years to just be a coincidence. My 4K version that’s only 2 years old is already freezing, and acting up, and has to be reset weekly. Oh look at that now Amazon is pushing a trade-in program. What a joke. My Rokus don't have this issue. Looks like I won’t be purchasing anymore fire-sticks.",1
Zialex mom,Stopped working in less than a year.,We have now had 2 fire sticks - both stopped working in less than a year.,1
N&M,Doesn’t power up,"We have a couple firesticks throughout our house and they all work great.  This one is junk.  Every couple days I have to reach behind and unplug it so it can turn on again.  Researched it and seen other people are having this issue.  I tried it on a different tv, different outlet, rebooting it.  Nothing.  For now I just unplug and plug it back, but it’s getting old.",1
Shanna ,Nothing but problems!,"I've had nothing but problems with this 4K fire stick. I've had two others in the past. Only one of them worked but when I stopped using the firestick in my living room, my second firestick failed to work in the secondary location. We moved and still the secondary one is super slow, glitchy, doesn't respond. It has different shows in the kids profile than the prime app on apple tv. You get what you pay for so go directly to an apple tv device!",1
Tiffany,Streaming still buffers,"I had problems a couple of streaming services constantly buffering. Had an earlier version , and looking at specs, thought that this newer version would help.. WRONG!!! Still buffers, tried direct connect with ethernet connect, still buffers.  I moved to my laptop, sites work fine.. Wasted a lot of time and money. I have Excede as an IP, 50Mbps down/3 up.  The sites that give me issues are paramount and Disney.",1
Merrill,What a CLUSTER!,"Had I known how difficult it was going to be to put this 'stick' to use I would have bought cable.  Amazon is a multibillion dollar company so why do they need to hire non-english speakers in a foreign land to register their already purchased device.  The procedure necessary to turn the dam thing on was unbelievably difficult and much different than the fire stick I was replacing, it was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT!  Enter this code, get a phone number then call the telephone number (wish I spoke Hindi) now enter this code, now check your email...If this thing ever quits working you'll see me back with Spectrum or even dish...",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Volume Doesn't Work,Just received this upgraded version and already during set-up the volume doesn't work..!  This has been an ongoing problem with these remotes for the last 3 years that I know of.I've had so many Fire TV sticks and Fire TV boxes and NONE of the remotes work for very long if at all..! I only upgraded to this 2021 4k Fire Stick from the 2019 version because I need a working remote.  Ugh.!None of the replacement remotes ever work either.  Will be returning as I already know the two replacement remotes now being sent won't solve this ongoing problem.Right out of the box - and it's NON-working.,1
DJ,if you have U-tube TV don't use a Firestick,"I am so mad at Amazon I could scream (but there is no place to scream to).  When you sue the latest iteration of Firestick, every streamaing service but UTube TV works great.  Our old Firestick (that I specificallyt didn't update with the latest update from Amazon) also works great.  Amazon is havinbg a little war with google over UTube - I just don't don't want to be in th3 middle of it of it.  I'm going to turn this in for a Roku.  'this is totally not right.",1

pghmom,Sucked,Wouldn’t boot up to tv. They told me tv was outdated. But Roku Hooked up no problem. I still have the second fire stick that doesn’t work. More of a pain sending it back. And it makes for an expensive paper weight. Or football remote thrower.,3
MaddieD,Not robust,A firmware update will brick the device following a few years of service.  You will be forced to buy a new one.,1
Ed Martinez,Firestick,I thought it would be easy to do but I returned it I don’t want it anymore,1
Amazon Customer,Constantly needs restarts,"We bought this upgraded top-tier version in hopes it wouldn't have the same problem the older versions had, which is that the sound and video lose sync all the time (two or three times per day). Nope. It's still crap.",1
G M,"Constantly losing connection with remote, lame piece of junk","I bought the first fire stick 2yr ago, worst piece of junk I ever waisted money on. It didn’t do what it was supposed to, I cussed at literally every single day. I was hesitant on the new model but I had also bought the recast dvr and needed something compatible .  I can only say I cuss a little less but still every day.I’d recommend buyers to look elsewhere, even if it cost moreIf I were talking in person I’d have stronger wordsDo yourself a favor and buy something else",1
Trinitee A.,Used and not wiped clean,This is obviously used by DAN and never wiped clean.  Invasive!!!,1
Merrill,Doesn't work with Spectrum cable,Fire stick doesn't have the Spectrum TV app and even ways to download from unknown sources don't work. Very sad because we wanted to have a better viewing experience than Roku :(,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Still doesn’t mirror with iPhones,It was pointless to buy this since it doesn’t mirror iPhones. There are other products that do and can play all the same things!,1
mo,No news allowed,"I kinda like to know what's going on. NOT WITH THIS DEVICE. All non liberal news stations are chopped up into 10-40 second bites.

Not anymore.",1

Paul A. White,useless for me until i can figure it out,i have an older firestick on another tv so wanted to add one in another room. I use antenna and firestick - no cable service. I pay for several subscriptions which work fine on original firestick.  When i go to my favorite apps i get error message for signin saying my subscriptions have expired. so as of now unless i can get help its useless. I also cant see how to change input so i can see regular antenna channels.This thing is definitely not user friendly for tech deficient seniors.,5

Dissatisfied buyer,True garbage,"This was my fifth fire stick. The first four have worked great for years. I got the newest addition with the 4K.  The remote does not pair.  I tried every power cycling, double power cycling, & menu/back/left. After looking at multiple reviews most people say they actually throw the remote away and have to end up buying a third-party remote. I refuse to do this.",1
Alex,Would not purchase again.,"This is the 3rd firestick we have purchased.  The first two were excellent but this one simply does not work well.  It gets ""stuck"" and we need to turn off then on and sync it each time we use it.  We have replaced batteries in hopes that was the problem, but nothing seems to work.  It is very inconvenient to constantly keep doing this each time we want to use it.  Cannot get a replacement so I have to drive to the UPS store which is over 100 miles away.  Waste of time and money.",1
Paula Morgan,Didn't last but 3 months,"You would think that Amazon would have better products. I bought this Fire Stick less then 3 months ago and already is failing. Doesn't respond, tells me I have no internet connection when all my other devices are connected just fine, keeps on buffering, or just not doing anything at all. Do yourself a favor and stick with the cable company.",1
Merrill,The sound and power TV controls doesn't work,Awful. Not sure what's worse the product or customer service. Spent 2 hours troubleshooting on how to fix the sound and power functions do not work on remote. Then message customer service get sent to like 3 different people thru the chat option. And all of a sudden it's gone. No help at all.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Remote doesn’t work except for the power button and volume buttons.,"I have to continuously ‘reboot’ the remote to get it to work. The volume and power buttons work, but nothing else. So, I have to hold down the left, back, and home buttons, simultaneously, for about 20 seconds, and the tv turns off. And then won’t turn back on. Eventually, the remote will start working, and then connect to the tv. It’s about a 15 minute process before I can even start to watch my television. Annoying.",1

I've had this new one for a few days, got all my activation's set up (again).  Now I have to unplug and restart this stupid stick 8-10 times a day, very frustrating.  Every other time I try to return to home screen all I get is black screen, plus half the time the mute function does work without restarting stick.

Amazon Customer,Will not work on my older TV,"This device won’t work on older TVs.  I have tried everything to get it to connect to my WiFi.

Amazon Customer,Complete Trash,"Was such a pain to pair to wifi. Worked for 3 months before fire stick started not receiving commands from the remote.

I guess you get what you paid for and this is for sure cheap trash tech.",4
RobDad,Resent paying extra for features that don't exist,My remote died for my older fire stick.  I was advised to use a smart phone app which is apparently non-existent for my phone.

design_eng,BROKE MY EXPENSIVE TELEVISION! BUYER BEWARE!,"Simply plugged in the device and hooked it up as instructed, only to have it permanently damage my television. Now the screen dims rather severely every 3 seconds. The constant flickering really made my $400 television worthless. Dealing with Amazon customer support was an uphill battle that left me down and out.Buyer Beware!",3
Amazon Customer,One big sales add,This is the worst experience I have had with any streaming device.  Be warned that the interface is confusing.  If you purchase a channel there is no option to search on that channel.  You will be lucky to find programs you were previously watching. Random adds appear.  It seems as though it is deliberately confusing so that you will purchase individual shows on prime when you should be able to watch them for free on a channel you purchased to watch them on.  What a sham!!! Inferior all around. Do not buy.,1

Rachael ,Defective!,"I bought it because of the new feature buttons with direct access to Netflix, Prime, etc, but the control only worked for a couple of hours and stop responding; the tv screen went into a solid yellow mode with choppy images, I guess I had bad luck with this one, 'cause I reconnected the old fire stick and problem solved.",1
Jennifer H.,It won't install,I bought this new version & it won't install. It gets stuck on installing updates then the screen goes black. I've been on the forums & see quite a few other people with the same issue for many days. The reps say they have asked tech support but none have returned with an answer.I like my other firesticks but needed an additional one for another TV & was excited to get the new one.,1
jolaine banks,Decides it doesn’t want to work,I never had this problem with Roku. Used a roku for over 10 years. Suddenly I switch to fire stick and the remote just decides randomly not to work. We try all the fixes on the screen. Not one works. Very frustrating. Do NOT recommend.,4

Merrill,Poor showing from FireTV,After using Apple TV for the last three or four months I find a Fire TV a sluggish buffering mess my last fire TV 4K seemed faster than this device I’m guessing an over bloated UI which needs to be slim down by Amazon this newest offering is subpar compared to their previous versions of fire TV the Apple TV 4K is a superior product over this meager showing by Amazon. i’ve used every iteration of fire TV since they came out I think it’s time for Amazon to step up their game.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,This doesn’t work correctly,"The remote is messed up, it goes rouge, does things when nobody is touching it. Also for some reason I can’t go from app to app. If I’m watching app “a” and want to watch app “b” I have to reset, yes RESET the fire stick in order to switch to another app. Also this fire stick freezes often and seems to have slow streaming",1

About every 3-18 seconds, the program stops and goes into buffer mode. these last up to 28 seconds.  If you try to fast forward during a commercial, it will go into buffer mode from3-36 seconds.  An hour show takes one hour, 45 minutes to 2 hours to watch.  I have tried watching several recorded shows, and this happens every time.Update.  Live shows are now buffering.  3 1/2 hours to watch 3 one-hour shows, even with trying to fast-forward during commercials.",1

When we called Amazon we were told too bad and that was none of Amazon’s concern.

I wish Amazon would collaborate with Xfinity to get this resolved immediately.I must say that the Amazon Fire TV Stick works well with all of the other apps I have tried. Why it doesn’t work with the Xfinity Beta App is very disappointing.

Mr. T. George,Need 2 people to set up…. Very frustrating,My LG tv is large and up high… I cannot access it by myself.

We took it back and got another brand and we haven’t set it up to work with alexa",1
K. Taylor,Remote is piece of crap,Bought this to replace my previous one because that remote was very fussy- kept unpairing-so I thought I would just replace it. The remote on this brand new one doesn’t work at all- will not pair even though I tried every trouble shooting thing I could find (LOTS of people having remote problems) But I downloaded an app on my phone and it works fine so it’s definitely crappy remote. I’d send it back but I think there’s probably a good chance that one would be crap also. Very disappointed. Don’t buy unless you’re ok with using your phone as the remote,4
D.J.,Seems Smoother 🤔 8 Month Update,I have 3 other 4k sticks saw this latest version and needed another so I got one. Seems a little smoother than the original but it may just be me. Good streaming device. 👍 BUT WAIT ... UPDATE: After 8 months with light use it won't connect. Says no signal on every device I plug into. No Way to fix it. Warranty is still valid but when you go to do a replacement it just goes around n round. This is wack. My other sticks are fine. Don't get this one with the pre-installed buttons.,5

I'll give it a few more days and then see what happens.",1
Jim Deets,Definitely NOT recommended!,I own 4 Fire Stick 4K. In less than a year and a half 2 have failed. A 50% failure rate. And now they won’t replace it. A 90 day warranty tells you everything about the quality of this product. I definitely do NOT recommend this product.,1

Jan,The remote has a very short life span,"I bought two of these and both the remotes completely died between 1 and 2 years. No amount of battery changes, reset etc. could bring them back to life.

Lori B.,Not the best,"Honestly it just kind of sucks. If you pause a show longer than 5 minutes it defaults to black screen, you have to push home TWICE (doesn't respond to any button once), and then you are started all over.

I hate the fire stick.",5
Silverado 4086,Problems with green screen!,"There have been reports that the fire stick has developed a problem with a quick flash of green bars on the screen.

Rene,Stopped working after 2 months,This stopped working after 2 months. I called Amazon to return it. They had me call my cable company-which was a nightmare.

Mark R. Wietstock,Planned obsolescence,"It works amazingly well! Exactly as described. So I bought four more. After about 18 months the plan obsolescence kicks in, every two weeks one of the remote controls dies.

Jim A.,A dud!,We have several Firestick devices in our home. We have not been pleased with this recent Firestick purchase. It glitches and gets off network every few minutes. We’ve gotten to the point that we have unplugged it and don’t even use it. We are very disappointed with this purchase. If we still had the packaging we would’ve sent it back.,1
Venkat,Very disappointed,"The only thing about the remote is for selecting the app.Does NOT turn unit or TV on or off, does NOT control the volume.Spent an hour on the phone with technical support in South Africa, as long as the technician was locked into the unit all of my controls worked as soon as he released my unit the problems were and still are there.The only way I can fix issues is to UNPLUG the stick and plug it back in.",1
Andrew McElwain,Remote drains battery 🔋,I was initially very pleased. However I have gone through 3 sets of batteries in a week! The remote is draining the battery and I have to replace it constantly & pair it over and over. Very unsatisfied with the remote.,1
SMcKSpragg,It's a amazon device.  Cut the cable OR WiFi,Don't trust this device.It's EVIL!!!!!,1
david j,Item is not what was advertised,"The item was supposed to be the latest version. That was not the case. Very deceptive advertising. This was outright misleading and was recommended by Amazon. Watch out for these scammers. In addition the item preforms very poorly. I would not recommend the Fire TV Stick 4K to anyone, even those that do not mind lower quality video. The device offers poor video performance and yields constant buffering. It is my recommendation that buyers steer clear of this device at all cost. Very Respectfully, ProAppraise",1
nethaji,Not user friendly,"It is not very user friendly, when you want to delete something that you are watching, you have to get out to your recorded shows, then delete it, instead of having the option to delete right there, don't have the option of selecting how many channels are on the guide list, has to many and are hard to read.",4
Casey,Very unreliable.,"I bought the first generation of Fire TV years ago, and loved it. I bought the second generation when it came out and immediately had reliability issues, including frequent random crashes. After that I switched to Roku and found it far more reliable, and with less annoying advertising on the screen to deal with.But recently I wanted to try the feature where a Fire TV can use an echo speaker/subwoofer pair as a home theatre, for use in my living room. So I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K to try it. This was my experience:- The main screen is extremely busy, with giant advertisements for sporting events I have zero interest in taking up the entire screen. I have to scroll down several times to get to the streaming apps I use. 1/5 for main screen design and user experience.- Once set up the video streaming was good, and high quality. 5/5 for streaming quality.- When setting up the echo home theatre it did not register my speaker/subwoofer pair as an available option. It was listen but greyed out. I tried multiple times that day and it was always greyed out, with no explanation why. I tried again the next day and it was magically available, so I connected it. 1/5 for making the process so unreliable.- Once connected the audio quality was very good, and I put on something to watch. 5/5 for audio quality once connected.- Roughly once every hour the audio would be replaced by either silence or static for about 5 seconds before reconnecting. So this home theatre option appears to be very unreliable. 1/5 for home theatre reliability.- The remote/Fire TV frequently has an odd lag, where I'll push a button and it'll take about 1 second before the screen responds. I don't know if this is an issue with the remote or the Fire TV. It make for an annoying experience. Additionally, when I press the power button to turn the tv off, about half the time it'll turn back on a second later - as if it sent 2 power button presses to the Fire TV. BTW I'm only sitting about 12 feet from the TV with no obstructions at all. 1/5 for remote reliability and user experience.After 2 days of annoyance and frustration I'm switching back to the Roku, which works reliably, and giving up on Fire TVs permanently. The first gen was great, the ones since then have been unreliable. In fact in my experience most Amazon devices have been very unreliable - Fire TVs, Fire tablets, Echos. I think I'm done with Amazon's poorly made devices.Overall 2/5 stars total for the great streaming quality, but everything else is awful and makes it almost unusable.",5
Steven R Brown,"Purchased certified/refurbished...worked great, until it didn't.","Purchased certified/refurbished on 6/4/2022 for $27.50 and installed/set up the Fire TV Stick 4K device a couple of weeks later.  Device was listed as ""Condition: Used - Acceptable - Small cosmetic imperfection on the item associated with regular use"" so I figured, no big deal.  A small cosmetic imperfection was worth the $22.49 in savings (normal $49.99 + tax) especially since there was no visible imperfection when I received it.  Then without warning, the device stopped working 9/3/2022.  Called Amazon support on 9/5/2022 and after 30 minutes of troubleshooting, it was determined the device did not in fact work and needed to be returned.  The Amazon rep was helpful, but could only process the return for a partial refund of $22 because I apparently purchased  from Amazon Warehouse instead of Amazon.com even though my order details show the seller as Amazon.com Services LLC and the $5.50 would be held back as a restocking fee.  Considering I had to return the Fire TV Stick 4K because of a defect and purchase a new replacement at a higher cost, I felt this was unfair and voiced my disappointment.  The rep was sympathetic to my concern and indicated she put a note on my account and said I could call back after my return was received to request the additional $5.50 to be credited back to my account.  I appreciate the additional amount will be refunded once the return is received, but I don't look forward to having to reach out a second time to close out this process.  Why not just refund the full amount from the get-go and save everyone's time?  Return process is convoluted, warranty coverage is unclear on a certified/refurbished device (apparently it is not covered by the 1 year warranty if purchased from Amazon Warehouse) and while the rep did the best she could, I think there is clearly room for improvement in selling certified/refurbished devices as well as in the return process involved.  I'd be more inclined to recommend purchasing a certified/refurbished Fire TV stick product if the return/replacement period was extended and the warranty period was more clear.  Here's to hoping the NEW (not certified/refurbished as I have decreased faith in the longevity of those products now) replacement Fire TV Stick 4K I just ordered will hold out for longer.",3
Mary,Worthless for my needs due to crippled functionality,"I have had a Roku for years and use it a lot for streaming.  I recently decided to try out Amazon's Music Unlimited HD service, specifically to listen to some Atmos encoded music.  I discovered that the Roku couldn't play Atmos audio, so after researching Amazon devices I selected this one that says it will play Atmos when it's available.Well, that should be ""when it's available as part of a movie soundtrack"" because apparently it will not play Atmos mixed music only tracks from Amazon's Music Unlimited HD service, at least not when it's connected to anything that could actually play back music in surround.  Apparently Amazon believes that people who are interested in Atmos/spatial audio are content with fake surround via headphones or a small all-in-one speaker system.  Beyond that annoyance, this device seems extremely buggy.  I've only had it for a few hours and have already encountered this:1.  Upon initial playback, it reported my system was limited to 16-bits, 44.1 kHz audio even though it's capable of 24-bit, 192 kHz audio.  It was downsampling everything regardless of which audio setting I selected.  The system indicated it had a firmware update and I applied that, and then it immediately had another firmware update and I applied that.  After the second update I noticed that my system was finally recognized as 24-bit, 192 kHz capable.  Oddly, there was yet another firmware update applied about an hour later and after that my device was supposedly only capable of 16-bits but at a 192 kHz sample rate this time.  Nothing else changed during this time, so clearly there's something wrong with this device in terms of determining the input capability of the device to which it's connected.2.  When listening to music, if you scroll to something else the music will keep playing.  Maybe some people like that implementation, but basically it means that if you decide you want to stop listening to music you have to pause it first before navigating somewhere else.  If you decide to go back to the Music app it doesn't actually return you to the screen showing what's currently playing but rather the Music app's home screen.  You actually have to navigate back to what's playing to see it on the screen.3.  The Music app crashed once after I changed the audio setting.  The music stopped playing and when I went back to select the Music app, it just loaded a grey screen.  After that, I had to restart the Firestick to get the Music app to load properly.4.  The menu system is overly complicated for many things.  1/3 of the home screen is an ad.  You can display the audio settings in the Music app but have to go to the Home screen and then navigate to the correct area under Settings to change anything.  With Prime Video, however, you can change audio selections within the app.If you don't already have a streaming device and want this to stream TV/movies, maybe this is a reasonable alternative to a Roku.  I'm not going to bother trying to use this device instead of my Roku for Netflix, Amazon Prime or Xfinity Stream, though, since the Roku does what it needs to do.  This Firestick device is going back to the store.",1
Sean,Stop. don't buy it! No space even for app updates :(,"The older fire TV sticks were much better! With this version of the stick, I can't delete Amazon default apps I don't use and there is not enough space to update the apps I do use. I have way more apps on the older FireTV sticks and never had a space issue. As once I cut cable and replaced with Fire TV, it appears it is time to cut Fire TV and rely on my smart TV. One of the older Fire TV sticks that I still use lags a lot and requires frequent restarts, which it never used to do. I suspect Amazon is pulling the old Apple trick - updates to older devices that make them slow and problematic which then forces users to upgrade. But there is no joy in upgrading because there is no space to do anything you want to do! There are tricks online on how to add space but I bought the Fire TV stick for convenience and don't want to have to revert to strenuous measures for something as basic as having enough space to update apps. It was bad enough when the main issue was an unreliable and short term life remote. Don't buy it. It's not worth it. Some of the new Smart TVs have an HD antenna already in place so you have both live TV and access to streaming apps. You have access to Prime Video as well if you still care for that with its forever audio issues - it's the only streaming app that has this problem, but I digress, this is supposed to be my Fire TV stick rant. What does Fire TV stick offer that a smart TV doesn't? Nothing worth sticking around for.",1
Merrill,Too locked down don't bother,"I initially bought this device because it's android based.  I wanted to root the device and use it as a low power torrent box.  As with all fire devices the fire os is so locked down you barely can do anything, it's hilariously bad.I have a fire hd 10 11th generation sitting on my desk until I can root it and actually use it and I think the same is going to happen to this firestick.  The first thing the stick does is install all this bloatware and updates the devices so its patched and can't be rooted.For making smart tvs smart it will do the job for netflix and hulu etc but not much else.  Also the Alexa barely gets anything right, it can't even navigate it's own layout.2 / 10",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Wasted hours & hours trying to make the remote work.,"Alexa worked, e.g., to “show weather” or “show comedies”, but not to “rewind 1 minute”.  Buttons to the left and right of the play/pause button, and the pause/play button itself, did not work.  I returned this FireTV for cause, and ordered a replacement FireTV.I had my son (a networking technology & intrusion detection guru) come over to see if he could help with the 2nd FireTV.  He set it up, and as I recall it seemed to work ok:  the buttons (see above) worked initially, but then they quit working.  Alexa worked, e.g., to “show weather” or “show comedies”, but not to “rewind 1 minute”.  Disappointed a 2nd time, I’m not sure what to do next.It is noted that the foldout leaflet was printed in a font so small I had to use a magnifying glass to read it -- not good.But now, even though all of the above problems still persist, there is a new development.  When I bring the Sling app into play, all of the problems clear up.  The rewind and fast forward buttons now work, as does the pause/play button.  BUT, only while the Sling app is running.The literature that came with FireTV gave me no inkling that running the Sling app would (just temporarily) clear up anything.  Maybe running other apps (e.g., hulu) would do the same.  It would be easy to just let the remote function properly from the outset, wouldn't it?  Not disclosing that the remote would not work is just wrong of Amazon.  Not disclosing that running the Sling app would temporarily make the remote work properly is also wrong of Amazon.I could remark that Amazon deliberately disabled the remote to force users to sit through all of the ads in a misguided attempt to generate ad revenue for their own advantage, instead of simply enabling the full function of the remote as advertised in their own literature.Will update this review as experience warrants.",1
Sandra Hoover,La mayoría es de paga,"Tengo prime y compré este Firestick con la idea de que iba a poder ver aunque fuera algunas películas en mi TV que NO es smartTV. Me costó conectar el aparato porque se da el caso que vino con baterías SIN FUNCIONAR y fue necesario utilizar el adaptador HDMI para conectarlo al HDMI.Mi sorpresa al entrar al sistema es que incluso las cosas que dicen ""gratis"", cuando entras a la película te das cuenta que ES DE PAGA, series y películas que dicen ""gratis"" todo es de paga, es una gran mentira. Quedé decepcionado con esto, y lo peor es que mis padres estaban emocionados. No vuelvo a comprar algo así a amazon.",1

tommie Jackson,Crummy plastic molding for the one component that matters.,"The device itself was fine but you could tell they've started using a crummy plastic mold facility. The battery cover of the battery cover has a sharp edge that doesn't fit the remote perfectly, resulting in an uncomfortable user experience with the one part we interact with. It will almost certainly cause buildup of skin cells in the gaps of the cheap plastic and will look gross within days. Inflation is hard but the remote is the one thing where quality of external materials actually matters. Very disappointed that quality control has fallen with a giant like Amazon.I've held the remote less than 5 minutes and (see pic) there is already visible build up in the seam. The hardware of the actual firestick seems fine and it works fine, but it's like buying a pen and the grip having sharp edges. Please don't skimp on the ergonomics of the one part that users have in their hand. How successful would a cellphone case company be if the edges felt annoying and uncomfortable...I know inflation and supply chain issues are real, but please have some level of quality control so the consumer doesn't have to sand down the edges.",1
Pablo R,Outdated Fire TV OS 6,"Don't buy this. For some reason, Amazon is still running Android 6 on this device and won't update to OS 7. Get the Max which has a newer OS and some other features that make it worth the small increase in price. OS 6 is so outdated that many 3rd party apps don't function properly. Apps that work great on my Max don't have proper remote control functionality on the 4k stick. Other than that, you can't add a usb flash drive as internal storage. And trust me, you are going to need it with the tiny amount of space you have. With all the Amazon bloatware, you'll be lucky to have 2 gbs before you've installed ANY apps. Why they can't offer at least 16gb of internal storage in 2022 is beyond me. The manufacturing price difference should be pennies and it hampers the functionality of Amazon's own apps which are typically over 300mb and cannot be deleted. If a 16gb version were offered for $10 more, 90% of people would choose to buy it. A streaming stick doesn't need much storage space, bit 2gb of free space is a joke for the peanut gallery.",1
Rhonda Morgan Gilreath,Does NOT show cameras like it says it does!,"Took me forever to get ONE of the two of these I bought to even work. And then it would not show the camera feed for my Wyze cameras. My other Firestick I had before I bought 2 of these DID. So I know Wyze is compatible. But I just get a ""Sorry, this device does not support cameras""... the main reason I got these was to install on small TVs throughout the upper part of my house so I could use them as a sort of CCTV to keep a watchful eye on my elderly father downstairs. And it doesn't do what it says it is supposed to. And then Amazon wanted to charge me over $30 to return them!!! I am disabled and homebound. In the past, any time I have needed to return something to Amazon, they've sent UPS out to collect it. I've never had to pay any extortionate fees! The customer service rep was just awful, too. Very rude and unfeeling. We have bought SO MUCH from Amazon, especially these last few years BECAUSE (due to our health situation) we are shut-ins. I always felt confident buying from them because the few times we ever had a problem with merchandise, the returns process was accessible to us. Apparently not anymore. Therefore, we will be severely limiting what we buy from Amazon from now on. We are on a tight budget, so we can't shop in a place with the knowledge that they don't stand behind their products if there is an issue, and they make you pay so much to return it, it's untenable.Buyer, be VERY aware!!!",1
Dan and Beth,Turns Alexa into a Karen,"Streams great. Terrible Terrible Alexa integration.

So I renamed them and Alexa dba Karen still thinks there name is TV or television and complains about it.",1
Luis,Worst Device Ever,"The new Fire TV Stick is one of the worst. I have had mine for about 2 months and have only been able to get the remote to work about 3 times. Alexa does not respond and when I want to watch the fire stick I have to manually get up and change my TV input to HDMI3 because Alexa doesn't understand how to help. I am regretting updating my old Fire Stick that works wonderfully for this one that doesn't work at all. I have called tech several times only to be told I can purchase a new one at a higher cost. definitely not worth your money or the headache.Update as of 6/29/22  After 3 hours of playing with this remote and Fire Stick I still can not use the remote to switch between Fire Stick and regular TV. It will turn the TV on and off and change the volume but to watch anything on Amazon Fire Stick I have to physically get up and change input by TV and then when I'm done watching Change back by TV. Alexa can do everything else via the remote accepts control of the TV. She can tell me the weather, and play music but can not control the TV. Definitely not worth the money I paid.",4
Mike J,Beware that Youtube TV doesn't work well with a Fire Stick,"I've been doing this dance for a year between using the Fire Stick for streaming and paying an additional $70 a month for YouTube TV live streaming.  It gives you a very nice DVR allotment, etc. however there is clearly a break down between YTTV and Amazon's Fire Stick.  It crashes way too much and has a lot of trouble syncing with the live feed.  I wouldn't normally take the time to write a negative review but I'm just sick of this.  Google obviously doesn't want to work with Amazon.  This needs to be acknowledged.  We also have a Roku and it has never had a single issue with the YTTV app.  I don't do conspiracy theories but after this experience...these 2 just don't work well together.  If you're planning on using YTTV for your live TV experience after cutting the cord, do not do so on the Amazon Fire Stick.  You will regret it.",5

trudy steffen,I’ve bought three. One had a problem and the other one bricked itself.,"Nov of 2019 I bought one. About the beginning of 2021 I bought two more. Of the two I bought one of the remotes would not pick up any voice at all. The button was useless. The one I bought in 2019 started losing over and over and would not get to the Home Screen. Yes I tried new cords, different hdmi cables, leaving it plugged in overnight, unplugging it overnight, hitting buttons on the remote. After some button hitting it went into the optimizing screen. It won’t come out of that screen. It’s been there for three days. Stuck. I think it went into a loading loop, slipped into an optimization but can’t come out of optimization loop because the loading loop is still there. Called Amazon and the guy said there is an update for mine! Well it updates automatically so I’m thinking the update bricked my firestick. They basically told me to buy another! 🤷🏻 Sucks when someone makes a product that kills itself or that a possible update could brick it. Of nothing else it should have a manual reset button built into it.",1

Only decided to keep it because I had a reduced price with a trade-in and it works as well as all the other current generation Fire TV Sticks. The biggest issues is Alexa integration in that it sometimes will control the stock other times 30 second later it will say there's nothing I can do that on.  Reboot both the stuck and the Echo and it works (I have this same issue on two Fire TV Sticks now.) On board memory is very limited and it's easy to run out of room and slow streaming down due to lack of cache space.

Laurasia,If you have regular ROKU this is not worth the price,"I do not have Alexis so cannot comment on voice controls. I bought this because a friend told me that I could get 1000s of movies going back to 1939 just by typing in a title. One of my pet peeves is finding  a movie to watch and then find out I have to rent or buy it. Then I found out that to see those movies costs $250 a year. So I  have not done that yet. But compared to regular ROKU this is a total waste. It is harder to use, you cannot search for anything, I still cannot figure out how to load channels, it shows you the tab for sites like HULU but none of the controls on the remote can get you to that tab so you are stuck with Prime and Neflex and a few others. Also you cannot switch between it and ROKU. You can run one or the other because you have to use the FIRE stick power button to turn it on and if then have to turn it off and power up ROKU. I suspect that there is a lack of control functions because you are suppose to use voice commands that come with Prime service but if that is the case I still do not see the benefit of this over my old ROKU. After about a month Ino longer even use this fire stick at all. The only reason I have not returned it is because I may have to spring for the $250 to get the movies service. My friend said every movie since 1939 is on there, which if that is in fact true I may spend the money.",1

cody,Buffering issue still,"Bottom line: The picture quality is great, the new remote and Alexa integration is almost seamless (it doesn’t like raspier voices). However the WiFi issues/ram still don’t allow the device to function consistently and sometimes not at all.  When it works it’s great lolTo be clear the fire stick is my favorite device despite its issues, but I often reconsider this when the buffering issues still continue in every generation. This one is only a week old and it still happens.The reasons I know it’s the fire stick itself:Multiple devices in this house running at the same time to include 2 Rokus and an Apple TV and none have this issue at all—also to include the 6 computers used at the same time. None of the game 4 game systems lag either. I can literally use this side by side with the Roku and the fire stick will buffer and the Roku won’t and it doesn’t matter how many people are on the network at that time.The house is made up of IT contractors and gamers, we can’t function without a certain level of internet quality. You would have to move an entire office of computers into this home to max out the bandwidth.The isp is not throttling. It only occurs on the fire sticks in the house nothing else and it’s never during peak times.This issue occurs no matter what internet or house I use the fire stick in.You’d think by now the issue would resolve by this generation but unfortunately it hasn’t.",1
Renee Blake,Lowers the IQ of your TV.,"I honestly think this is the worst of all the streaming devices. It’s always breaking. You always have to restart/refresh/unplug, etc. all the time.  I’ve gone through several, but it’s my fault because I keep buying it (Mainly because it’s cheaper than most other devices).  I ordered the protection plan for the last purchase & have already had to order a replacement. Get this, the one that they replaced it with is also defective. The annoying part is that if it’s not one thing it’s the other. Now the remote is also broken & It’s not the battery.I have a few smart TVs, but I still like to buy streaming devices for many reasons.  I have appleTV on the main TV, Roku on another TV, one bedroom has an old AppleTV, Roku in another bedroom, & FireStick in my bedroom. I figured I’d save $$ by getting the FireStick. Well… bad idea.  Either every one that I get is defective or they’re all just junky.  BTW - my bedroom TV is also the only TV that isn’t a smart TV.  The FireStick doesn’t add to its IQ, either.  Oh well, I guess I’ll buy another ROKU.",1

gaj,Fire stick,It is ok. Disappointed with the small remote and no way to input the channel I want directly. I had the dvr with cable company and could pause and fast forward through commercials and the fire stick you can’t fast forward since it shows not allowed,1
L. Fontes,Remote constantly disconnects from stick,The remote will not stay connected to the firestick. Remove and reinstall batteries and it works for 1 minute.  Chatted with Amazon and they had me unplug everything for a minute then restart. Worked for a couple weeks then went back to same issue. Unplugging not working now. Very irritating.,1
Julia,Lags problems,"I had the 1st Fire Stick and it work great. I have it for more then 3 yrs.Just about a month ago I purchase a Fire Stick 4K and it's not working very well.The 4K lags too much and to many times.  It would disconnect from the wifi, off and on (the wifi signal strength is very strong; it's less than 3 ft away from the modem).My other devices that require Wi-Fi works great. No issue with the Wi-Fi or the internet access.Amazon send me a replacement but the second one is having the similar problems.I am still trying to resolve the issues.I am thinking that I might have to return this product again.",1

Lynette K. Carson,Do you like view a dark picture?,"People have noticed for years that Amazon delivers prime video movies and TV with a darker picture that cannot be conquered by mortal viewers. Silly me, I bought a Firestick 4K and learned that if you use it to stream other apps, like Sling, then THOSE pictures get dark too. Which means you have to move your apps to your smart TV's home page if you want to get the full effect of your great TV. Which makes the stick pretty much useless unless you like gloom. Amazon has some good programs, but they are not watchable in 4K, and as far as I can tell from looking at the letters and forums, Amazon has no plan to fix it. So there is no good reason right now to recommend a Firestick. Unless you're a cat.",5
Merrill,Doesn't Play Well with Hulu+ Live,"Bought a Fire stick years ago and never really used it. I had to dust it off, upgrade the software and use it recently. That's because we ditched our cable service and went with Hulu+ Live.  There is no native Hulu option on my TV.  The Hulu service worked with the Firestick but was wonky. There was always a delay between the audio and people's mouths moving on live TV. Last week, all of Hulu went dead. Couldn't get anything on Hulu let alone the live channels.Today, I dusted off my old Roku stick, updated the software and got it running.  Thete are no problems whatsoever. There's not even a delay.  I guess Amazon doesn't want to play with Hulu.  As exhibit #2, if you own a Kindle (we have 3) you can't use the Hulu app on them either.  I guess it depends on the generation but our Kindle are only about a year old.What's up Amazon?  You're not making customers happy like this.  Especially, this one.  The next time I need a tablet, might have to try another brand.",3

John R Waren,Worked great at first,"Loved the fire stick at first. So many streaming options, voice recognition, but most importantly I only needed this one remote to control my tv (turn on and off, volume, etc.). After about 4 months the remote died, not just the batteries the whole remote will not connect. I tried using the remote app instead which worked for a little bit but that now stopped working too.",1
Cher Dumas,"Low Quality Remote, Everything else Works as Advertised","This product worked pretty much as advertised.  The sole issue i had was poor manufacturing quality for the remote control.  The primary, center button doesn't seem to fit into the remote very well, like it catches on the arrow buttons next to it.  So, when you push the button down, the button also randomly depresses an arrow key, making your on-screen selection go haywire.  For instance, you hit the main button to select a show, but instead, the remote sends the ""go up"" command than then ""select the show"", so you get the wrong show.  This happens two out of three button pushes.  Low quality control from manufacturing.I put in a request with Amazon, their automated system said it would send a replacement, but now I can't find a record of that and my return window has closed.Hopefully this is a one-off manufacturing issue and not present on a large number of remotes.",1

Missing,None of the firesticks have 8gb false advertisement,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Now don't get me wrong love the firestick great device issue is storage and the way its advertised this device should have 8gb of storage and 1.5 memory pre installed apps and updates is gonna reduce it to 3.85 gb and that's what's left of the 5.43gb you actually have.  I would appreciate if amazon gave me a device that actually has 8gb with 1.5 memory.  I understand you can add external storage that's not the issue so let's make sure we stay on the issue. When you buy a phone or whatever and it's advertised as having 256gb storage when you look the it say 256gb storage. I would like amazon to do right by me now I will do a correct review on the product. Also Alexa never picks up what I say I end up typing it in. Right now Amazon has not resolved my issue. Next issue I had was connectivity every so often thi thing would disconnect and say no service I had to separate my router from auto to show 5gz and 2.4ghz and connect it to 2.4ghz directly in order for it to not have issues.,1
Cesar Saquicaray ,Lots of Trouble,"We purchased the Fire Stick to hopefully replace a cable box.  To set this up, you have to download EVERY channel you watch - it is a colossal pain in the &**.  Then when we disconnected the cable box to use only the Fire Stick, 3 of our TVs would not work.  Overall, it will work, but it is a huge hassle and we don't use it at all.",1
Ep,I’m stuck,"I wanted to record over the air TV.  The only option I could find was fire TV recast, to use that I needed a fireTV.  For about 80 days I seem to get what I wanted.

So far that one hasn’t died, YET.",1
Kristina Pagan,Xfinity App and Firestick Problems,I have a Firestick gen 3 and a Firestick 4K. Both of them have issues with the Xfinity Streaming app. The app work great until you hit a commercial and then the screen freezes for up 10-20 seconds several times. Once you get back to the program you are watching it will play properly until the next commercial break when the cycle repeats all over again. I have no idea whether it is the Firestick itself or the Xfinity app that is at fault here. All I know is you can set your watch to the predictable behavior. I have complained to Comcast about the issue and now I am complaining to Amazon hoping that somebody can figure out what is causing the issues. Same problem whether using wifi or the firestick ethernet adapter. Frustrating as heck.Edit: I should have noted that the Xfinity app is the ONLY app that has the problem. All of the other streaming apps work perfectly with the firesticks.,4

Just keep trying to use app until it works.  Other issue I learned is that there isn’t enough power to connect usb to TV.  The thing kept rebooting and wasn’t working.

Design a model with a number pad and I'll raise my review to 5 stars.",1
Amazon Customer,Firestick perfect! Remote defective!,Firestick is perfect! It is the remote control that is frustrating. I believe I received a defective remote control. Upon turning the firestick on it either displays a message about not detecting the remote or a low battery message! It displayed the low battery message 2 days after I hooked up my firestick (with the batteries that came with it). I then bought a new pack of batteries & 3 days later displaying the same message.,1
ngraham,Works but can use some more user friendliness,It is too difficult to return back to what you were watching.  Loses connection a bit too often and buffers a lot.  It’s not perfect but it is usable and I think it should be more like regular tv. Simple and user friendly.,1

Tonya,Works great...when it works,"Out of the gate we love fire sticks. Have them on every TV. The consolidated streaming options just work really well for our families needs. BUT it doesn't take long before they are glitchy and/or unresponsive. We inevitably find ourselves having to frequently unplug and reset them, as the stick will randomly and frequently become unresponsive to the remotes. The child's account on the app, while great in theory, is particularly confusing for them when tv shows appear on their home screen that they can't actually watch because it's tied to a service we don't subscribe to. The fire stick and related app setup needs a TON of work, but thankfully aren't that expensive compared to cable networks and such so for now we continue to buy them and deal with the annoyances.",1
H Sanci,Does not sync audio to picture,I have a Roku box that I've been using for years and I've tried the fire stick.

About half the time the volume buttons won't even register. I've never had these issues with older style fire remotes. Very disappointing.",4

H. Toast,Silk Browser SUCKS,I'm on my second Fire Stick so I know what I'm talking about here.  It lags.

Alyssa,Not as user friendly as Roku or Apple TV,"I hate that it is so hard to search and find shows and apps. Amazon really needs to read the Apple playbook when it comes to simplification. Also, Amazon needs to collaborate with more of the streaming companies so that when searching for a movie or show it will find the show on the apps you have downloaded. Also, it is obvious the device is geared toward easily promoting and finding Amazon shows and products. Please give me a device that is not trying to sell me more shows or products.",1
JD,My Roku 3 is more reliable🙄,I have a Roku 3 and 1st gen AppleTV 4K. Roku was getting slow opening apps so I decided to upgrade and didn’t want to shell out the money for an AppleTV which would have been my first choice. So it was buy a newer Roku or try something new. So I went with Amazon’s Fire Stick. Interface seemed okay. But I kept having app issues that I didn’t have on other steaming devices. First I noticed Hulu would get dark when a new episode came on. And I would expect a good experience since there is an actual button on the remote that takes you straight to Hulu. It was really annoying. And then YouTube kept crashing. I’m done. It seems like they are not on top of app updates. Hopefully I could still return this. I’ll likely get an updated Roku or cough up the money for an AppleTV. I could probably even stick with my Roku 3 and be happier than I am with this thing.,1

Larry Ponziani,Not as good as my cheap Roku TV,I have had fire sticks for many years and been very happy. This one will integrate with all of my programs but one. I cannot log into Nat Geo TV app. The fire stick tries to log in for me and then tells me that it is not part of my programming package and it is. I can go into my bedroom where I have a Roku TV and it logs in no problem. This is the only issue I have with this. I may start to replace them with roku's if I can't figure this out.,1
Merrill,Good when it is working but stubborn when the volume doesn't work,"Since the first month of buying this current firestick, I had issues with the volume. Sometimes it would behave so good but once in a while, it would be so stubborn and when it is loading, you don't hear the sound when there is that fire logo and then no sound at all and the the firestick would turn off. I would try and try and try again until it works. Again it is happening but lately it really hard to get it back to work. It is not even a year yet of purchase. I am really looking into other devices to make my TV smart.",1
Mark R. Wietstock,Bad color,"I ordered this for my friend, I got it delivered and my friend used it but he did not like it as all channel through this had bad color/blurry color. I returned it and it got delivered back to Amazon on 8/19 but I have not got the refund yet.",1
Kavita Malhotra,Very good release except volume control problem.,Very good release except volume control problem.  Everything else is just fine and as advertised.  I really like the TV control that has been added.  My major complaint is that the volume control is not up to par.  In order to hear the program correctly the volume has to be up to 80 or better and the unit only goes up to 90.  If I use the apps on my TV instead of the stick the volume is perfectly good at 35 to 45.  Same with my Blu-ray player apps.  Amazon needs to correct this.  Really irritates me.  This should be handled by an update for the stick...,4
Mariah Huseby,Visually Stunning,I love my Fire TV Sticks. I dont own a TV that doesn't have one. It's unfortunate Amazon didn't Crete a hub you can connect all your TVs to and run your programs on all TVs from that Fire TV Hub...,5
Opa,Not for live TV,"I have had it for 3 months now. I steam live TV and I watch a lot of sports. The Firestick freezes up when streaming live TV. At first I thought maybe it’s my internet but I have a small smart TV in a room upstairs on a WiFi connection and it never freezes up while the Firestick is downstairs sitting 12 inches from the router and freezes up every single time. This is my second Firestick, I was hoping the newer model would work better. If you only stream prerecorded material like Netflix it works good but occasionally the app will freeze and when you exit the app it does not close it. If the app freezes you have to unplug the Firestick to restart the app, but to be fair this is minimal. Over all if you want to stream live TV spend the money to get a smart TV or be prepared for the frustration of it freezing, usually at the most critical part of the game.",3

Adriana Garibay,"I wanted a faster firestick than my old one, and this one is, BUT - the picture ruins it.","I just wanted a faster connection than my old firestick (2nd gen) but didn't think that they picture would actually be different, but it is. The new firestick is doing what a lot of the new TVs are doing, tweaking brightness and color so much that it is ruining movies that I have been watching for years that I loved and making them practically unwatchable. They have made greens, yellows, and sometimes reds garish and overly bright, they have made the images either too dark or too washed out and I can't fix it on my monitor. I have the brightness down to zero and it's still to bright and that's not right. It makes me want to go back to cable it's so messed up. I think it also messed up my old firestick that I loved with an update so now it is too bright. The colors are just all off. I don't know what Amazon is trying to do but this cannot be a sellable product if it is ruining movies. I hope they get enough complaints and fix what it is they did so we can have our old displays back.",1
Melissa Walrath,Idk why they say it's 4k,"Unfortunately I wasn't able to be sure I was getting any 4k playback. The only app on fire tv that allows you to set the resolution is YouTube, and despite having a 4k tv, a 4k fire stick, YouTube would max out playing in 1080p and does not let me put it any higher. In netflix I know not everything is in 4k, but I didn't notice any difference between this and my 1080p firestick so I can't be sure that this thing actually displays in 4k",1
Lamar,Needs work,My first one lasted 3 years. I guess that's good. Bought this new upgraded version and it only lasted 8 months.

I restarted the stick and it started to work again.  At the same time, my laptop never lost a connection.  Then it dropped the connection again and exited the espn app.  I restarted it and it would not connect or launch the espn app so I just switched to my laptop and watched the game from the browser.

Mark R. Wietstock,Very buggy - other than that it works well,"I've owned the FS 4K for 7 months.  It has two persistent bugs that still pop up on a daily basis.  First is that the audio will suddenly get very distorted and crackly.  Power cycling the Firestick clears the audio problem until it happens again.  The second bug is that it will spontaneously reboot in the middle of TV viewing.  Suddenly the program disappears and you see the Firestick Amazon logo and after several seconds it brings you back to the home screen.  This is totally unacceptable - otherwise it would be an excellent device.  I use it to watch YouTube TV, Netflix, and Amazon Prime as well as video files on a flash drive.  Connect a USB flash drive by using an OTG adapter cable plugged into Firestick's micro USB charging port.  Install the VLC app on the Firestick to play video files on the flash drive.",1

Amazonion,Hmmm worst than older firesticks...,"Performance is worse than my older firesticks and for some reason the remote loses connection with my Samsung TV also another flaw. I have all the latest firmware, on the firestick and remote, but it's still randomly disconnecting... maybe a specific issue with mine...?",1
Merrill,Lasted less than 2 years.,The fire stick worked well for about a month or two. The image was clear and 4k did work. Then one day I started getting flickering off and on. I knew it had to be something with the resolution and I set it to 1080 for everything and that fixed it for a while. I changed HDMI ports and updated firmware and every possible thing I could. I tested my TV and the ports with my PS5 and it was fine so it was for sure the fire stick. The flickering started again about a week ago and just last night it died on me. Lasted less than 2 years. I would expect something for 40 to 50 dollars to last a little longer and work better. I will stick to my PS5 to watch my apps. Looks and runs better anyway. I will never buy a fire TV stick again...,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Too much update on this product,That doesn’t work with Disney+,1
Jan,Defected remote,Perhaps my battery life isn’t lasting in the remote I have replaced batteries 3 times,1
Tim Hopper,The quality of the plastic parts on the remote feels cheap,"It works good but it is hard to understand why Amazon, having the best shopping website on the Internet, cannot use the sample design principles to organize the content of FireTV. It is a mess of free channels, paid channel, movie history, movie suggestions and the visual mess changes content and placement of content daily.",1
Rebecca Bryant,I dont like it,I installed it in my children's bedroom and it is complicated and slow. voice commands is not great and you have to repeat it several times. I would no recommend it,1
Hershey,Fire Does Not Navigate Well + Cannot Remember Login Information!,"Yes, Fire and competing devices are a nifty idea; and necessary given the structure of our television programming. However, Jeff Bezos did not do his homework on the Fire TV device. It frequently gives me trouble when going to CNN because it cannot remember that my CNN access is thru a cable provider. It is consistently frustrating!It is also clunky when navigating to many platforms. It just seems to not know how to understand where you want to go; what you want to connect to. I believe that part of this problem is that it quickly fills the screen with content that Amazon or some other paying customer wants to sell.So - come on Jeff Bezos. The technology needed here is nothing new. Please improve Fire!",4
Julio,Dead after 2 months,It’s a piece of junk. At least this one. Not looking forward to replacing it 4-5 times a year,5
Shawn,Storage,"The reason I purchased a new streaming device was because  I thought my old  one was  no longer  performing  well.  It slowed  , picture quality was degraded, There was  no available  room  for any additional  apps.  I was soon to discover not only was I no longer able to add new apps.  There were certain  apps that I couldn't  update.I found  myself shuffling apps, updates, and features.",3
Calie Reed,Limited space,"While I like the speed and the normal functions of a fire stick, this is not an upgrade! I can only have 1-2 apps and it says it is critically low on storage (for us, Hulu and HBOmax). And none of the other streaming options (Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, or ESPN+) can be saved externally so there is zero way to add them.  I am super disappointed in this Fire Stick. It either needs more storage to handle all the normal apps people use or a built in way to add external storage instead of the the work arounds I have tried that have all failed. It is a constant issue the out of space!",1
Chris Kurth,Buzzing,Kept buzzing when trying to use it and wouldn't work right,1
BAJ,Issues with Firestick,"It's been hard for me to navigate with the fire stick....features, etc.  I'm never sure if I click on something if it's free or if I am buying it.  I thought I would get Fox News, but sometimes I do and sometimes it dosen't come in.  Now it's saying free subscription is over. I have Amazon Prime and also Youtube TV.  I feel I can't get a lot of the older shows I like.  I'll get them for a while with Prime and then it seems like I've got to start a free trial.  It's not going as well as I'd hoped...and I bought 3 fire sticks. I have company and they are having problems, too.  Disappointed.",1
elrey,Do not think this will be easy,"I spent 3 hours before hitting a wall.  Almost every step is difficult, and some, so far, impossible.  Even the free You Tube tutorial person said he did not understand why Amazon made it so difficult just to open the battery compartment on the Fire Stick remote. It took about 30 minutes and a few You Tube tutorial, but I finally got it open.  After getting through that step, the next instruction was to pair the remote with the television. Sure! That was little different from saying ""build a rocket, fly it to Mars, and see if it works better there.""Amzn tech support was not very helpful, although I understand that Amazon actually can build a rocket and go to Mars.",1
Merrill,Not happy,Not happy with this buy right now. I own a few of these fire sticks as I have a few TVs in my house and with this one the remote isn’t working. It was just delivered yesterday and it only works when I put a set of new batteries in. I have changed them 4 times now and it’s not the batteries.  Getting really frustrated.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Works great... when it's working,"I really like the function and features of the Fire TV Stick 4K. The previous one we had only lasted 4 months though, which is not acceptably durable.",1
Bru™,This item has a faulty remote that requires you to constantly adjusting battery for use.,"This item has a faulty remote that requires you to constantly adjusting battery for use. This becomes more and more aggravating. I reach out to see if I would be able to get just the remote replaced by Amazon, unfortunately that is not an option.",1
Allysa T,Lasted exactly one year,Not as good as they used to be. It lasted exactly one year to the day. And I did not buy a refurbished one. But now I have no choice but to order one again for my TV,1
Larry M.,Live Streaming,I got a Firestick exclusively for watching MLB games on the UZZU app.  It is continuously freezing up yo the point it is unwatchable.  The other channels work fine.  Our internet connection is great so that is not the issue.  Not sure if it is the Firestick or the app itself.,1
chris,Not like cable,I don’t like it. The remote is cheap. I’ll take cable tv anyday.,1
PK08,Eventually Loses Connection,"Just as the two Rokus I went through frequently lost connection after a few months, so does the Firestick. They seem to “wear out”. Purchased just before Christmas 2021. It is now 3/11/22 and the Firestick has already started freezing every 30 seconds or so. The streaming picture is fine when it’s not frozen. Other than that, I’m not really into “Start/Stop” programming. I prefer to see a steady moving picture. NO, there is nothing wrong whatsoever  with my WiFi output. In fact, it’s been upgraded. I guess the next step is to go all out and buy a smart TV… see how long that lasts.",1
Greg W.,Disappointing,"So disappointed in this device. It was challenging to set up (I’m old, so take that with a grain of salt), but I finally got it working only to discover the picture is very dark. I’ve researched possible causes and solutions, and none of them have worked for me. I have discovered that this seems to be a fairly common problem with the Fire Stick. Additionally, I have to keep signing in to my Apps, which is a pain. I also find the navigation through menus to be clunky and annoying. I could tolerate all that if the picture quality was decent, which it’s not. Perhaps if you are more tech savvy the Fire Stick will work fine, but for me it’s just a a huge disappointment.",4
Linda,So slow if it were faster I’d be so happy,I was so excited for my fire stick to arrive and got to setting it up immediately! Fling story short that took TWO DAYS because it kept saying the internet quality was too poor but we have an extender specially for this purpose. It finally let me set it up but now only Netflix works and HBO go only sometimes but take forever to load. None of the live channels work which is half the reason we got the fire stick. I’m going to contact support to see if they can help us but right now I feel defeated frustrated and feel that this was not a good purchase. We previously had Roku and thought it’d be an upgrade but right now it feels like a downgrade.,5
Greg Mayer,Loss of signal,"Continuing losing network signal. Sparklight has helped… but was told that to many people on a network slows down stream, and then show signal loss…",3
littlerock,Have to restart a lot,"Every few days, I have to unplug and restart my firestick. This is very annoying. It should not do this after 9 months of use.",1

Merrill,No Remote battery life,"The remote battery life is 2 days. after researching it looks like bad design with the Alexa feature, it appears to be draining battery within 2 days.",1

Camijaee,"The fire stick is okay but the instructions sucked, I still can't use it.",Needs much better instructions.,1
Vanessa,Kills batteries!,The remote needs fresh batteries every evening unless you to move them each might.  Is that because Alexa is always listening?,1
Douglas,can't afford cable anymore but this is a poor substitute,"had to give up cable to pay the rent but this costs just as much to get the same content. i still have to pay god forsaken comcast for the internet. i live in a florida ghetto and they have a monopoly, which is double their cost of anywhere else in the usa. then it is all plus, plus, plus. you pay higher separate rates for every movie and streaming channel. the ''free'' channels have more commercials than syfy.  i have lived too long. now they'll charge to breath the air, pollution and all.",1
Amazon Customer,Too many ads,"We had been a firestick family for years.  I’d bought this one as an upgrade for an older version.  I then started noticing how many ads the home screen had; it’s become increasingly difficult just to locate my downloaded steaming apps.  I worry about exposing my child to unnecessary ads.  There’s the add banner at the top, then suggested content which is essentially ads, then there is the row that has deals on content - ads, then half way down the screen there is usually a banner ad for another steaming service.  I’m over the ads!  I’ve returned this purchase and switched out my Firesticks for Roku, which has considerably fewer ads!  (See pictures for comparison)",1
Give me what I pay for,No longer works,"I bought this item in November 2021. I hardly used it bc it was hooked up to a spare tv that is hardly used. So, Iam disappointed that it doesn't work. When I connect the adapter to the TV, it has lines going across the screen,",1
Vinh,Remote stopped working,"Bought this as a replacement to an old, slow, outdated Fire Stick. This one the remote stopped working within the first month. Should have bought an Apple TV!",4
joe,It's acceptable,I don't like not being able to switch back to previous channel or enter a channel number direct. You have to change channels by scrolling through the line up or on the guide. On the upside the scrolling function is fast.,5
Marlo U. D. 🪁,Glitch in remote,"It has flaws such as not starting back up without unplugging and replacing If I turn it off with remote, when I turn it back on next morning, I have to unplug it for 10 sec and plug back in. That is annoying. The old one I had didn't do that.",3
Barry,Software set up can be tedious,"I use a receiver to utilize my custom sound system. I feed the Firestick into the receiver and use my television as a video.Compared to the earlier Firestick It has been very difficult to sync the receiver , TV and Firestick .The software explanation needs work . Alexa is no help with the installation .",1
Merrill,stopped working after 8 months,After it started to crash (reset) Amazon would not replace it. I spent hours on the phone trying to repair it. I went back to my ROKU.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,Another dud,"I did this to myself.  I had a Fire Stick that worked fine.  I wanted to be included in my first Prime Day so bought a 4K stick since my tv was 4K.  It worked well for 6 months or so and then certain apps kept crashing.  I cleared the cache & data, did reboots, etc. for 2 weeks and then on Black Friday ordered a new Fire Stick (my 3rd now).  It has been 4-5 weeks and already crashing.  One show kept going to old school snow but only using the Fire Stick.  Then I watched a Prime Christmas movie that kept randomly going back to the Resume screen.  So my new Roku came today.  I hear they are better.",1
Eric,for visually impaired it is horrible,i have to have assistance because i cant see the script,1
Gustavo,Remote control doesn’t work,"i bought this device in november 2021 and now the remote just stopped working, i already changed the batteries but it doesnt work",1
Reyes Bazan Georgina,Not impressed,Remote was flakey until it has finally died. The stick just goes to La-la land when using our Harmony remote.  It hangs and will not respond to buttons being pressed.  The tv light flickers with button presses so I know the harmony remote works. A replacement firetv remote is expensive. Might as well buy a whole stick/remote again.  Stuck in the firetv realm.,1
fsdfdsf,It hurts!,The product looks like a normal 4K Firestick BUT the Circle is hard to manipulate up.  I hurt my fingers every time I attempt to go up on the screen circle icon.  I hate this remote!,1
Jessica,Volume will not work with my TV,I cannot get my volume to work on New FireStick,1
Andrew P. Frits,Disappointing,"The Fire Stick does have some nice features (the ability to control TV and sound bar with the remote, for example) but its primary function, video streaming, is just mediocre.The device constantly freezes up or buffers endlessly when streaming video content. A restart will fix the issue for a while but the problem will come back after a bit of usage. Couple this with the constart barage of ads and promotions from Amazon it makes for a terrible user experience.To me the Fire Stick seems to get quite warm - maybe overheating is the cause of the problem.I have had a much better experience with Roku, so I will be returning the Fire Stick and going with Roku instead.",1
Amazon Customer,Hard to configurar,Hard to install,1
BJ G,Not very good,Doesn’t always work,4
mr. williams,4K model does not control Bluetooth volume,Every model of fire stick except for the fire stick 4k controls Bluetooth speaker volume. Very annoying to deal with one model being worse for no reason.,5
Joe Andrews,Voice and video loses sync,Often voice and video is out of sync.  Doubt it’s my internet service because I just upgraded to fiber.,3
Merrill,Remote not working after six months. low quality,The remote is of very inferior quality and does not work most of the times.,1
Mark R. Wietstock,doesn't work well,"I'm not sure if it's my fire stick, or my WIFI or what, but I can't seem to get this one to do anything I ask.  I've never had one so maybe it's just me.  This was only $29.00, on sale from $40.00, so maybe there are better ones out there.  When I ask Alexa to do something, it takes me somewhere totally different.  I just recently ordered Paramount Plus and couldn't get it to download on my smart TV so I was told to get a fire stick and that would solve my problem.  Well it has not.  Very bummed out and not sure what I will do next!",1
goodluck74,"We have problems with Direct TV streaming, pausing live video during live sports events.",Fire Stick will work with Direct TV Streaming but we have had much better streaming with TV’s using the Direct TV Streaming boxes than using Fire Stick. The TV using Fire Stick has so many instances where Live sports are paused and the same happens in other prime tine shows. The worst problem is with live sports events.,1
Mike N.,It worked till it didn’t,"I bought it to upgrade my older fire stick and I’ve had it 4 months . I’ve made sure it’s remained updated etc. for the past month and a half, it’s been restarting mid streaming’s. Shutting off for no reason I’ve tried every single trouble shooting thing and it’s not working. It’s crap .",1
KCJP,As described after you restart it,Have to restart device every time or wont stream or load. After that works as expected,1
David hampton,Literally eating batteries,This is my third fire stick and the remote is going through batteries literally in one day! This can’t be normal.,1
Delicious,Pure unadulterated garbage,If this isn't any better than the fire stick I bought 6 months ago then spend the money and go with Nvidia.Constantly having to completely power down to straighten this garbage out. Audio out of sync most of the time. Sometimes there is audio from 2 different channels. Constantly freezing. Amazon should upgrade everybody for free. Every friggin' day i have to unplug the power.....every friggin' day. Sick of this worthless device. And to make matters worse I own 2 of these worthless ripoff. SPEND THE MONEY...BUY SOMETHING BETTER,1
J. D. SWOFFORD,Loved it until my remote stopped working,My remote stopped working and I feel I didn't have it for long.  No warranty for this so now I have no way to work the channels.  So they need a back up for this.,1

B u s h r a,No good anymore for Disney or HBO,"Since the latest update, neither Disney nor HBO will work. Can only watch these platforms from a smart TV that don’t rely on the fire stick or online. Very frustrating!",4
Lea,"Affordable, but Not Worth It.","Had an outdated Apple TV so I got this as an affordable alternative to replacing the Apple TV. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work very well. The major streaming services fair well but anything else - Bravo, VH1, etc., won’t  play seamlessly. I have to click on videos over and over to try and coerce them to play - I’m generally just looking at the spinning wheel. Some apps I’ve never gotten to actually play. Unless you just want the major services, I’d pass.",5

Mark R. Wietstock,Wasn't two years old and stopped working. I was told to replace it!,"Fire Stick... 2 issues.A) Lots of reports that they do not work well, or at all, after about 2 years.

Clay Gronskei,Fire TV Stick 4K Problematic,"At least once a week when I want to stream NFL GamePass I have to reactivate the app. It either shows me logged off and to log on I have to reactivate it or it shows me logged on but when I try to watch a game it says I need to buy a subscription. I have to log off and reactivate it to get past the problem. A terrible experience with this app. I have removed the app, rebooted everything, and tried adding it again but the problem doesn't go away. Other than this problem it works OK.",2
Amazon Customer,"Great at first, but after a couple months.. problems","The streaming photos is a nice touch, but certainly not worth the problems with the device.  2 months after I purchased the item, after watching a few shows, it would play the next episode with sound and a frozen screen. I switched to my Smart TV and everything worked fine. It did this several times, so I decided to just watch the smart TV.  Today, I tried to use the fire stick, and there’s a problem with the sound sounding like a frequent loud screech throughout my show, so again, I’m switching back to the tv to watch access my apps.  I purchased a fire stick to be able to get HBO max, but I can’t use it to watch anything anyway for more than 30 minutes. I miss my Roku, but my TV works great.",2
Ashley Coleman,Battery killer.,The remote is consuming a new set of batteries every twenty-four hours.

Tom ,"I might have a lemon, it got disconnected all the time. The older version worked fine.","I understand it is an easy fix, just unplug the FireTV from the outlet and replug, but why do I have to stand up and move when I obviously want to do remote control and even voice control? Would love to return for a replacement. Quality wise, it is much nicer than the old FireTV (first or second gen) which was not high definition.",2

Doug Miller,Needs an update,The 4k fire stick desperately needs an update. It's too slow when compared to Roku and Google TV/Chromecast. 4k looks great. Alexa works great. But the processing speed for apps is just to slow.Also I don't know if I just have bad luck but I've had 3 4K fire sticks break. They just stopped working for no reason. After the 3rd time I had enough. I went and purchased a Google 4k Chromecast and it works flawless!,2
Cecil Overstreet,Quality,"I trust the cursor will be permanently removed and able to speak to device and press enter, period. Am still considering returning it. Am blown away on how cheaply the product was made, makes noise when U press the button.  The stick light it's even worse, poor thing is about to break into pieces. For the pride on the expensive devices, they should be in better quality. Doodles",2
Lynda Brady,Clumsy poor design,Clumsy and hard to open. Yuk!,2
HRV,Is it not compatible for all streaming?,The product itself is good enough but if you have a smart tv it’s probably not worth it. I got this for my mom and she’s tried to stream tv shows on Peacock so maybe it’s a problem with them but it won’t play her show. It will load for 30 seconds to a minute then go back to the Home Screen. Sometimes it works but I don’t want to have to wait and try for 30 minutes to watch a show that’s 40 minutes long. Again it might not be the firestick but peacock is working on all our other devices.,2
Merrill,Freezes up.,It constantly freezes up and it has to be disconnected and reconnected to power before it will work properly. Not internet because it doesn’t do it on any other device.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Difficult and time consuming to set up!,The firestick remote offered no control of volume nor could it turn the TV on and off in spite of buttons being present on the firestick remote. I had to use my TV remote to carry out these functions. After 2 hours of time wasted that I’ll never get back and chatting with 7 tech support workers I finally was able to obtain volume and on/off on the firestick remote. For those of you who don’t have 2 hours to waste “ go to settings > equipment control > manage equipment > TV > change TV and follow the onscreen instructions”. Make sure that you input “Amazon firestick” as your TV.,5

I factory reset both, updated both to the latest firmware.I now have 2 painfully slow Firestick 4k.",2
Curtis Chandler,It was not the right productct for my TV viewing,"It is hard for me to give an accurate review on this product. Most of our TV viewing is on broadcast chanels.  I did not know how to find them using this product. I wasn't sure how to search for the streaming chanels that we watch. I was hoping it would be a good alternative to the u-verse that works for us. I was hoping that it would reverse the cost of the At&t' and Comcast bills. If you are a Tech savy person, it might work for you.  Installatiin was a little tricky but I was able to do that fairly easily.",2

Mark R. Wietstock,Small issues add up,At first the only issue was Disney+ not working. After lots of research and troubleshooting I eventually got that to work.  Now my issue is the remote battery. The first set of batteries lasted 2 months. The next set lasted a week. The next only 2 days. Now fresh batteries read as low. I’ve tried resetting which just led to connectivity issues. This is a really common problem that they’re not bothering to fix. Super frustrating.,4
Clyde,Very difficult to turn on.,"Replaced an older Fire stock. New one is faster once it’s working, easy to use. But more often than not, need to unplug it and reply to start it up. And since it’s Amazon there is no hope of getting an actual human for support, beyond the FAQs on the website. Think Google Chrome or other alternative!",5
Amazon Customer,Runs and uses data after you turn it off.,Strength quality was okay. Not very happy about the setup. We moved it from one TV to another and it wasn't very easy getting the remote re-synced to the other TV. Then found that you have to shut it off a certain way or it will still run and use data. Roku is easier to navigate. Alexa worked pretty well.,3
Amazon Customer,Poorly engineered device,"The product streams well with good quality.  However, the remote control looses connection, device performance is poor with applications hanging or responding slowly and the Alexa voice recognition is terrible.  Apple firetv app does not maintain  connections and has poor performance.  The interface is poorly designed and difficult to use. Applications have custom interfaces that make it difficult to use with so many interfaces. The only good thing is it’s cheap.",2

Review,firestick was not easy to connect without wifi,I wanted to make this hardwired. Bought three devices from amazon to make this work. When this didnt work bought 3rd generation fire stick. The new remote would not pair up. Used the old remote-finally had the option to be hardwired but then said connected with a problem. Called customer service -2 or 3 times.Finally got someone who knew what to do. Needed to deregister device and register again. This worked and my firestick is now hardwired to the internet,2

I couldn’t find the app at all, and when I found it once, it said unavailable.

I’ll likely be returning both of the firesticks due to that problem. I was so happy to find them in good deals during holiday season, but now I’ll have to find something else.",2
Jason,PBS app could not stream video,"This is a beautifully designed, small device that connects to the HDMI port. I have a high end 4K LG TV with a Marantz receiver. I purchased it because LG does not support the PBS app, but Fire stick 4k supports it. Setup of the Fire stick was easy and I downloaded the PBS app. It verified that we have a PBS passport account and all seemed fine. The live streaming of our local PBS station worked perfectly. However, no matter what I tried (clearing the cache, rebooting the fire stick, re-installing the app), it would not stream any of the PBS videos. It would simply go to a blank screen. Disappointed.",4
J. M. Mahoney,Edit...not so hot,"Everything was the same. It's the 2021 release of the same 4k stick as the 2019. A few extra buttons. I upgraded my router through my internet provider to get wifi-6 & with the combination I haven't experienced any lagging, loading, buffering, or choppy picture since.Edit: the titles & mini trailers aren't matching up. I've reset my stick multiple times. I'll stop my selection on a certain movie but the mini trailer will be for a completly different one. I'll select a movie to play on a certain channel & it's also not the same. Very frustrating when it's happening about 20% of the time.",5
Gary Kennedy,"Loses Sound, Picture goes dark then appears then disappears again","I was upgrading from a previous fire stick and wish I hadn't. In the middle of shows, it will lose sound and you have to get up and unplug the firestick and restart. Also, it will lose picture and screen goes dark, then it comes back, then it goes dark again.I asked Amazon for a replacement, not a refund, a replacement and my request has been completely ignored.",3
Keith Keltner,Not built to last (how else would they get me to buy more?),"Update my rating 6 months later. My old firestick worked for years. This one crapped out after 6 months.

Manuel Izquierdo,Remote doesn't work,"The device works fine and streams as inteded. However, the remote stopped working. Went through all the help pages and got it working again after the tedious reset process. However, after turning off the device and turning it on again to use it, the remote does not work. I would have to go through the same reset process every time I want to use the remote. The only way to use it is through the app.",2

Cleveland Nash,Great picture but RARE Dolby Atmos.....Dissappointed!,Great picture but RARE Dolby Atmos.....Dissappointed! Always been very pleased with my MANY  Amazon devices but purchased this fire Stick just to get Dolby Atmos (as advertised) but LG Smart TV and Google Chrome get them all.......but not this thing.......does not give the info whether Dolby Atmos is on a particular program as the other devices do and you may get Dolby Atmos by chance on a rare occasion. A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT!,2
BarryG,Constantly restarting and not working,"This isn’t good enough to use for watching television. It might be fine for watching some YouTube clips every once in a while but it’s not robust enough to be used as a television streaming device. It is constantly crashing and restarting in the middle of shows, it doesn’t remember where you were in the show so you have to fast forward to the part you were at (if it’s allowed), it always loses pairing with the remote, the remote is too small (it’s like an Apple TV remote) and lacks critical buttons like channel up/down or tv input so you have to keep multiple remotes. Would not recommend",2

Stacy Johnson,Cheap,"I purchased this to replace out old FireStick. I was waiting for them to go on sale. I did get a sale price but I found them $10 cheaper now. So disappointing. It works like it is supposed to but it feels so cheaply made. When you press the center circle to choose the back of the remote feels like it is going to cave in and break. I have checked several times and it is on properly so it is not loose it is just cheap. I will not purchase one again, at least from AMAZON I will get one from a retailer.",2
ToolMan,Most unreliable Fire Stick ever!!!,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 We have only had this device for 2 weeks and we have had several lockups where we had to completely, remove and power off the stick to fix, sound settings continuously have to be reset because of no sound problem.  The first Stick we had one problem in 3 years and we just had to plug it in to the wall instead of the TV USB-A port. Now I have to set aside some time to talk to support!!!",2
Ed Oler,Wished I stayed with ROKU,I dislike the fact of remote stopped working and had to download the app for the remote on my tablet... I have done ALL of the problem solving steps and still doesn't work,2
Amazon Customer,This first time buyer not impressed at all.,Randomly drops apps while playing movies. Too much buffering. Roku H.D. player never buffered or dropped movies. You can not truly binge watch any series. Because it stops after each season. And returns to home screen. Roku player's display all your apps on home screen. While fire stick only displays six apps. At a price point of $20 or less. At best I rate it okay. But at any higher price point. Buy some other brand player.,2
Merrill,"Was working, but no longer. disappointing that it only lasted a year","Was working, but no longer. disappointing that it only lasted a year",2
Mark R. Wietstock,Eh. Not impressed over the 2018 model,I thought it would be much better than the 2018 model. Quality isn’t that much better. I still have to restart it on occasions. YouTube is still awful. (Thinking that’s a YouTube issue). Not impressed overall. Thought it would be much better.,2

Edwin  Alfaro,"Great device, but forces ads on screen",Had I known it pushes banner ads on the screen I would not have bought it. Otherwise a great device but I refuse to buy a device that forces me to watch ads. Now I know why I need to pay extra for an Apple TV or something else.,2

iarizona,I would not  recommend this you need a 4K Tv,But I didn’t know that you need a 4K TV because it shows very blurry I wish the 4K Option to turn off because now I’m a have to even buy 4K TV or buy another fire stick because the picture is not clear and I’m not sure if it says that on the box but I wish I would’ve known because I would not have purchased it that’s my fault and also Amazon for for not being clear about the 4K I would not recommend this unless you have a 4K TV,4
AmmoDump,Constantly resets,"I'm using only OEM parts, just what came in the box, but the fire stick constantly gives me a black screen and stops my content. I have to use the entender because of my tv design. This is really frustrating considering it seems like they gradually removed the capabilities of my last Gen fire stick, which never did this.",5
WiseOldOwl?,Remote doesn’t turn on,"I just received this device.  My friend likes the fire stick so I thought I would give it a try.  I’m sorry now, hooked everything up and the remote won’t turn on.

John,Not a good one,It doesn't let me download apps in playstore. It blocked most contents except Amazon stuffs. I returned it. I took 2 weeks to get the refund after calling Amazon 3 times. I never buy it again.Especially anything belongs to Amazon,2

Mark R. Wietstock,Loss of signal continues with new Firesticks,Updated my old Firesticks with this new 4k model hoping to eliminate loss of signal when streaming. Same as old model this one goes to black screen loss of signal every 15 to 30 minutes. I have the extension cables to improve reception and the unit reports excellent signal strength. I'm returning for a Roku I'm done with Firesticks!,2
K.cited,2nd 4K Firestick FRUSTRATING,"The 1st FS failed after a years use. The 2nd one works great when it works. Must reboot weekly to monthly be unplugging  ehind TV or through the app if it will let you.Why they don't power down the stick along with the TV I dont know. That is, if you turn off with the power button all it does is turn off the tv. This is like never rebooting a pc or android device and the operating system starts to hang or freeze. I'll be switching to Roku or something else!",2
Emma,Great device with one BIG flaw,"I loved this device at first. Easy setup and remote controls TV.  However, there is one huge flaw.  It interferes with other devices connected to Wi-Fi. I have a smart TV and several Echo Dots that started intermittently dropping after the Fire Stick was installed.  From what I’ve read online, it’s a common issue. It uses Wi-Fi direct to control the remote, and that causes issues with your Wi-Fi. It’s a completely untenable situation. Buyer beware!  If anyone has a solution, I’d love to hear it, otherwise this device is going back.",2
cathy paularinne,I wish the remote didn’t burn battery so quick,It burns the battery pretty quickProbably defective,2
Amazon Customer,The HDMI cord is too heavy.,"The HDMI cord is too heavy and it droops downward, which affects the quality of my TV picture and sound. I have to use tape and thread to hold the cord in the correct position  also my screen darkens and the voice sound crackles. I have to shut the TV off for 1-2 hours in order for it to function properly. I didn’t have this problem with the original FireTv Stick.",2
NSeana A.,Bluetooth audio delay is unbearable,"The delay of audio using Bluetooth audio is more than a full second. There’s no options to adjust the audio/video sync. Purchased mostly for this capability, considering returning. Only using Netflix and prime video so far. Wouldn’t recommend if that’s an intended use. Streaming video quality has been good so far.",2
Canoe Traveler,Not a streaming device but a sales tool.,I own a different version 4K stick with a remote that doesn't have promotional channel buttons on it. I would rate it 5 Stars if there was a way to remove all unnecessary/unused Amazon apps. I would still give that version 4 1/2 stars and it is available on Amazon. (Reference: Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa Voice Remote) The extra buttons on this remote simply encourage you to subscribe to services so they can make more money. They are just in the way if you don't want to pay subscription fees.,2

Thomas burrows,"Service is good, remote is very poor quality","Needed a new remote as the original died an early death. It was cheaper to buy the wholesystem, then to purchase just a new remote. The remote on our other tv with firestick has died as welland needs replacing.  Amazon needs to change suppliers and ""up"" the build quality of the equipment.",2
Merrill,Cost,"I did not care for the sneaky way I sign up initially.  There was no option to to Paramount + essentials.

Mark R. Wietstock,it isn't good for me,it is amazon friendlyThis item is not working as well as it says.

Steve,Not as good as the older models,"I have other Firestick models that have worked fine but this new and ""improved"" version pales by comparison.

Maria,It is not 4k. You have to pay extra every month to get that service.,I was hoping I will be getting a better quality than my tv. But my tv is much better. To get 4k I was asked to pay extra every month on the fire stick. Really disappointed.,4

Amazon Customer,No sleep timer,"It works fine. I don't like the sleep, it doesn't have a timer on it.

Joe Blue,Misleading—worthless,The Amazon Fire Sticks are quite worthless if you want to watch anything.  It is not even a poor substitute for a live cable tv system.  Despite having a 300 MBPS download rate the system is unable to keep anything running.  Want to watch a particular channel?  You never really get to see it.  You merely get snippets of a show.  Our worthless internet provider told us we would be getting internet (via modem/router) AND cable tv but they lied and said you can get cable tv with the fire stick device.  Total garbage.  Every time you turn around you have to download another “app” to see anything.  Amazon should be sued for misrepresenting what they are capable of providing.  If you want to watch a particular episode of a series show you have to fast forward through the first xx number of episodes.  It doesn’t take you to where you left off.  You have to wait and wait for the little time out indicator to stop.  It just spins and spins.  Worthless junk.,2
CSloan,Fire stick stopped working,I bought a fire stick last.year and it stopped.workimg..can I trade it.in or exchange it.for another one,4
Judy Singleton,Not worth the money,You need to constantly buy new remotes bc their quality is so bad that they stop working. I should have saved up and bought something else. The alexa integration is a joke. I doubt you,5
Carlos A. Cardoso,Terribly slow,"You get what you pay for. Cheap streamer. Cheaper experience. Gets super slow after time and forces you to buy a new one. Just gonna buy an Apple TV and be done with it. No this isn’t a sponsor. It’s just insane how frustrating it gets after a while, all I can do is warn the next customer",3
Daniel Corral,"Great price, but I recommend Roku.","Freezes at least twice daily, and has to be restarted.  I have 2 of them, and both are the same.  An old Roku on another TV way farther from the router never freezes.  I also made the mistake of buying a Fire dvr, which only integrates with Fire sticks.  I'm guessing Tablo is much better.",2

Kyle R,Anyone else have problems with remote not syncing with TV?i,"I have had this firestick for about 6 months now and couple months in the remote just stopped connecting . I unplugged eveything than plugged it in and  the other things they tell you to do and it didn't resolve problem. Then a couple days later it started working , I have no idea why . A couple months later it's doing it again !",2
Tasha,Always complaining about low space,"I have 2 fire 4k sticks I bought at the same time and they're incredibly frustrating. I bought USB sticks and the cords to set up USB storage with it, but hardly any apps support USB storage. Amazon forces a ton of apps that use up basically all of the space so you can't install more than 1 or 2 apps on it. If you want more than Netflix and Spotify than find something else that actually supports expandable storage. Even on apps that are on the external USB (Paramount and HBO are the two I found that worked), I often get errors in the middle of watching that it ran out of storage and I have to go through the menus to restart it.",2
Kandi,clunky and slow,"You get what you pay for. Once your movie starts it is OK. If You plan to navigate through menus and find the perfect show good luck. Clunky UI, bad menu design, slow apps, sloooowww everything.",2
Merrill,Do not Buy,"This stopped working after 1 month, most of the features don’t work on the remote anymore",2
Mark R. Wietstock,This device is awesome!,We cancelled cable and haven't missed it at all. The voice recognition is spot-on and being able to integrate all of my streaming services is great.,2
Don,It’s a mess,"-It takes 5-6 steps to open an app-It goes to sleep after 5 minutes and you have to restart the 5-6 step process to re-open the app and THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY FIXABLE 😡-very laggy and choppy transitions-the home page is constantly rearranged with ads and different apps you don’t even use which adds to the confusion and frustration-all in all it operates as I’d expect a $25 steaming device to operate. If you have a smart tv just use that, this thing is a total mess",2
BigK,how to navigate,Lots of buffering before picture comes through.  Hard on the eyes to navigate to one's goal.,2
Yogi4Lyfe,"Basically ""zero"" onboard memory/storage space (but see update).","This is my first experience using one of these Firesticks ... we got it specifically to allow us to download/use game apps like Jackbox on our spiffy new ""ultra everything"" QLED TV, without having to connect or ""broadcast"" from a laptop or other external portable device.  So far, it's working great for that, and I'm beginning to appreciate all the apps and access/content it adds to an already impressive lineup of stuff that came with our TV.  A lot of the apps are duplicative, but a few aren't, and those ones are nice add-ons.  My only criticism is the ridiculously limited amount of onboard memory storage it comes with.  6GB?  Are you freaking kidding me?  The OS and native apps literally consume half of that; we downloaded ONE Jackbox ""party pack,"" and there went the remaining storage space in the Stick.  Fortunately, I quickly figured out that you can add an external drive through use of a specialized splitter cable and external USB drive (sold separately), and then use the settings tools in the Stick to format/incorporate the drive into the Stick's ""internal"" memory.  As tiny and cheap as memory has become for manufacturers to add to such devices, I'm baffled as to how/why Amazon wouldn't just put a LOT more memory in these things from the get-go, and not make its customers resort to third-party cables/memory resources to make the gizmo function in ways most of its users want/expect it to.  Last thing I would say is, make sure you take the time to download and install all available updates when you first power up/install the Stick, and keep checking for new updates at least once a month.  Mine's a brand new 4K Stick, yet I had to go through 6 or 7 update cycles before finally getting to the screen that says, e.g., ""your software is up to date.""11/24 update:  In my initial review, I indicated there were tools present in the OS for the Stick that allows the user to add external memory.  That was based on a YouTube tutorial on the process I saw before I actually got the cable/memory required to do it.  Once I got those and tried it, I discovered that these essential tools have been REMOVED from the OS on the 4K Smart Stick!  After TWO HOURS on a chat with Amazon tech support, I was finally told, e.g., external memory/drives ""can't be used"" with the 4K Stick, which begged the obvious question:  Why the h*** is Amazon selling these things (AND many FireStick-compatible games) without giving customers either: 1) FAR more onboard memory for app storage, or 2) tools that allow SIMPLE formatting/use of external/third party memory/drives?  The chat tech was at such a loss for an answer to this question that she offered to refund me on EVERYTHING:  the Stick; the OTG cable adapter; the USB thumbdrive, AND the 2 ""Jackbox Party"" games I had already bought.  I took the refunds on everything but the Stick, and fumed for another day, convinced there HAD to be a way to add the USB memory.  Well, I'm here to tell you, I KEPT searching, and found that there IS another way, but far more complicated than the method I THOUGHT I'd be using when I ordered the expansion memory and required adapter.  I found another, excellent video on YouTube created by an English lady that shows how to do it, step-by-step, by downloading a DOS-based ""shell"" app that allows you to use the FireStick remote to communicate with the FireStick OS through a series of DOS commands, telling the OS to incorporate your external drive/memory into ""system memory"" for the Stick.  You can't ""see"" the new memory/drive in the OS settings/storage menu, but I've now confirmed that it IS there for storage of any new apps/games you download, all the way up to the maximum available memory on the new drive, in my case, 256GB ... far more than enough for my needs, and ensuring I'll never have this problem again for the service life of the Stick.  I'm now entirely happy with the performance of this device, but still fuming that Amazon, either by intent or sheer stupidity/neglect, put one of its long-time, loyal Prime customers in the position of essentially becoming a developer/programmer in order to make one of Amazon's flagship products work as it should.  One more star off for this, with the remaining three representing, e.g., otherwise good product; good ""try"" by tech support to answer my questions about what was going on, and (so far) great performance of all the apps/functions we're currently using on this FireStick.",2
Dan Tocher,Stopped streaming my videos.,"My Amazon streaming worked perfectly for about 4 years. Then suddenly the videos won't stream.  Downloading Circle keeps spinning.  After 1 hour + with customer service I'm told I have to buy a Fire Stick to get streaming.  Why that suddenly became the only way to watch Amazon videos is not clear but now they've got my money for this thing.  Fire Stick worked ok for 4 months then suddenly stopped streaming my videos.  It would only allow me to watch the free apps within Fire Stick.  Another 1 + hours w/cust service trying various things like restarting my tv and my router, unplugging the power, etc.  nothing worked.  Rep tells me to call my internet provider to get stronger wifi to my home.  (HUH?)  When I refused to accept that he said he's sending me a  new F. Stick.  then we were disconnected.  AARRGGHHH.  I get back on the phone w/another cust. serv person who tells me I don't need a new F. Stick....I should reset the tv to factory settings and then log back into my Amazon account...WHICH WORKED!  But having to go thru this nonsense ...well it should not have happened at all.  Took nearly 2 1/2 hours to get through it.",2
Amazon Customer,It does the basic job of streaming,"I got this for a TV in the kitchen and wanted something basic and this fit the bill.  I still prefer an Apple TV for any streaming in a dedicated entertainment system as the interface of Apple OS is more elegant and clean.  With the firestick and the Amazon interface, it's a bit clunky.  Of course, Amazon tries to push it's platform of Prime Video so you see that front and center.  Trying to access the other apps (i.e., Netflix, Disney +, HBO Max, etc.) is a bit clumsy through the Fire TV interface, but you can get there with a few clicks, whereas with the Apple TV, all the apps are right there in a grid when it comes on and you can customize it with your favorite apps on the top row.  The Fire TV doesn't allow you to do that (or at least I haven't found an easy way to do it), so would say it is less ""user friendly.""  I also find that it lags a bit at times when trying to access apps.  Other than that, if you are looking for a cheap streaming device on a TV that is not your primary entertainment center to access your plethora of streaming apps, this does the basic job.",4
Christina,Worst one yet ! This fails CONSTANTLY!( Update Amazon called me to help after this review,"I know it’s the stick bc I can put an old one in ( like 5 yrs old ! No updated remote etc ? And it will work but this one is GARBAGE! I have had to reload this 3 x this week alone !I have 3 tvs so it’s not my tv , the others are all normal w fire sticks older - this is my bedroom tvi think this is less than 2 years oldI got a fire tv but that thing annoys me so bad bc I can’t turn it in without unplugging it etc ( if I’ve left it off over a weekUPDATE : Amazon actually called me after this review and helped me update my software , let me know it was stil in warranty , etc . I’m changing my stars even tho no one asked me to. I just appreciate that they CARED I had a weird stick - I will probably use my warranty to replace this one but it’s nice to know someone kind will help you find he serial number etc .",5
andrew e burdette,It's OK,"As a long-time cord cutter, here is my review. I'm comparing to my older Roku(s) here. Going to state up front that I'm in a rural area and my Internet occasionally gets sketchy.Pros: It offers better bandwidth management options, especially for Prime video. This is the main reason I attempted to ditch my Roku(s). (Unless you have a nice router, a Roku will just stream at the best quality it can, regardless of how much bandwidth it is sucking up, especially for Amazon Prime).It's fairly snappy, running circles around my Roku.The Fire TV will pause if you set a sleep timer on your TV. This is great because the Roku would keep right on playing if your TV turned off.All, in all, for the money it is a solid device.Cons: During the occasional storm and other events, my Internet has gone out for a few days or so. When the Internet goes out for the Fire TV, it is pretty close to being relegated to a fishing weight.This isn't totally the Fire TV's fault, but the Plex TV app on Fire can't connect directly to a Plex Server. And even if it did, if there is no Internet, you can't get to a single %#%$#^% app on the Fire TV.I did discover that you can screen cast to it with no Internet, but you know what doesn't work with screen casting to a Fire TV? Amazon Prime (and I'm casting from my phone, which a lot of time still has Internet).The Plex app on Roku will let you use your Plex server even if the Internet is out (for the most part).I have a pretty good investment in my Plex server and have had to keep all of my Rokus on because they work much better with Plex.I was really hoping for a Roku killer and I would be done with the bandwidth sucking devices. Unfortunately, the Fire TV did not allow me to do that, so here I am with two different boxes now.Actually, because I just moved to a cell plan with unlimited Internet, I also have a Chromecast because streaming through my phone works better than my home Internet at the present.To date, I haven't found any Chromecast app on the Fire TV that I like, and even if there was one, it wouldn't work if the Internet goes out...because you can't get to a single app on the Fire TV without an active Internet connection. Like I said, the Internet goes out, it becomes a fishing weight.So here I am with three devices, and the Fire TV gets three stars because of that.------------Update: I did find after searching the Net that there is a way to launch apps on the device if your Internet is out. It's not obvious at all, but it isn't too difficult. On the Roku, you can get to all your apps normally, but they will warn you if there is no Internet. On the Fire TV, you have to dig through a bunch of menus in the settings.So, I came up with a setup I'm happy with. Turned on DLNA on Plex and installed VLC app on FireTv. I haven't fully tested this, but it should work to stream movies to my TV in the event of an Internet outage.Also installed VLC android app on my phone. From the Fire Tv or my phone, VLC was up and streaming movies with just a few button clicks. Now that's the way things are supposed to work. Good job VLC team.",3
craig ohman,No Other Option / Choice,"I have a 8 year old 65"" flat screen that you guessed it was outdated the moment I left the store with it.After years of not being able to update or add new  apps I had no other option other than to buy one of these.Pros: a lot of apps to choose fromCon: pray you never have to reset it. I have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting any information from a customer service rep.And wow Amazon a billion dollar company can't even use accurate images of the product on the instructions page.Remote: Can't stand that it isn't backlit. I don't know anyone who watches TV with a ton of lights on. So you can't see the buttons when watching TV at night.I wish the TV mfg were forced to figure a way or build a better TV. We shouldn't have to buy 3rd party sticks to add the ability to steam apps that are on new TVs.",2
Steve Benghiat,Remote stopped working - 2 months works again?,"Same problem my Apple TV, remote control head. It just stops working. Won’t be detected anymore. I did the whole push this button that button, reset, this reset that, check the batteries… Doesn’t work.  The workaround of courses load the app into your phone, but still. The company as riches Amazon should have only the best materials for a product they put their name on.  The Google Chromecast is the obvious competitor. Roku lacks a feature that these other two have. I guess on a lower note, the way you plug. The thing into the side of a projector is not thought through; because you basically have this Amazon fire stick, just sticking out the side. Which looks weird. If they had a plug that was flat along the edge of the projector, that would be much better. Meanwhile, the remote control doesn’t work and that’s a nuisance.OK n now, 2 month later, the remote works again…?Unfortunately, I didn’t notice what happened that made it possible to again pair the remote…",2
METALHED'88,Like a Black Hole,"Purchased a Fire TV Stick 4K so I could get rid of the cable box and remote my service provider was charging me for every month.  The good news is, the Fire Stick will pay for itself within 5 months.  :)  It was easy to install and, for the most part, is easy to use.  But NOT as easy as my remote was.  Also, the biggest gripe I have with the fire stick is that it is not backlit and I don't see one available that is.  Searching for the fire stick at night has been made easier by always putting it back in the same place - but even when you have it in your hand it's like looking for a black hole in the dark.  With it's matte black finish and without a back light, you cannot see any of the buttons to press.  I don't have (nor do I want) a night light in my room but when the TV goes dark I can't use the fire stick without turning the lights on and possibly waking my husband.  So while I love the idea of the savings I'll eventually see, I'm beginning to wonder if it's really worth it.  Debating whether or not to send it back.",2
Merrill,The remote only lasts 4 to 6 months!!,"I LOVE the Firestick!  But the remote is a spawn from hades.  I have had a Firestick for the last 5 years.  I have consistently purchased a new one every year, sometimes through Amazon and sometimes from Best Buy, because the remote dies and its more cost effective to just get a new device.  This LAST remote though!!  I purchased around September.  The remote died within a MONTH!  I have to put the batteries in the remote, turn on the tv and select a program, then take the batteries back out of the remote.  Want to change the volume?  Put batteries back in, change volume, take batteries out. Finished watching tv? Put batteries in, turn off tv, take batteries out.  The next day put batteries in and.... nothing.  Need new batteries!  seriously!! I am NOT happy!!",2
Mark R. Wietstock,"Was 4 stars but now it’s 3, stupid remote…","Everything about the firestick works perfectly fine. I’ve owned one before, so it nothing out of the ordinary, but the fact that the batteries didn’t last 3 months, doesn’t make sense, to me. How you selling a “new product” to someone and the batteries 🪫  are about to die? I mean, who puts old batteries in something, you’re selling? The answer is “a crook”. Someone that is trying to get over, when you could’ve just ♻️ the batteries, player, 🤦🏽‍♀️.Update: it wasn’t the batteries, it was the remote. So instead of 4 stars, you get 3, now. Nico, with Amazon customer service, had me kill more batteries, to give him the serial number. Then he caught an attitude when I called him on it. Batteries ain’t cheap, but he didn’t want to reimburse me on the now 6, batteries that this remote is killing, that before almost made it to 3 months, but now dies within a matter of a couple of hours. Either way, the crap is defective and Nico had no choice but to send out a replacement. Just wondering why he needed the serial number, if he was just gonna send… never mind, hopefully this remote isn’t refurbished, like apparently this one was. I just read some more reviews, and determined that the fix for the remote issues, is to go back to the old remotes, they worked. The reason why I don’t have my old one, is because I didn’t use it, so I sold it to a friend. But I need one now cause my LG tv won’t download DIRECTV Stream. But I wish I still had the old one, cause I never had any issues like I, and apparently everybody this year, is.",2
Brandon B,Unable to get help. May be defective,We’ve had this remote for a few month and it slowly began cutting out and freezing. I have reused the older one and works fine. I have tried it on several tvs and it does the same thing. We have tried to get in touch with support and we’re unable to reach anyone ( time of year perhaps)  the stick now cuts off a dozen times a day. I have liked the other models but since we have been unable to resolve the problem is why it is only getting 3 stars,2
Carol C.,good but remote doesn't work,I bought a fire stick and have been using it for 2 month now. The streaming in great but I have been using the remote app on my phone because the actual remote does not work. It keeps stating that the remote has low battery. I have changed the batteries several times and it still doesn't work. Alexa will also not connect due to the low batteries. I still give it 3 stars because the streaming has no hiccups when I use the remote app.,2
Michael bates,Picture clarity is great but color quality is awful.,"I have an older model firestick for my Samsung tv in the den and I absolutely love it. I never have wifi connection problems and the menu and picture/color is great.Bought this newer model for our tv in the living room for a newer Samsung tv. Start up is easy, has the great menu features but the picture is about a step up from black and white. No color adjustment in the stick that I can find and the tv picture adjustments don't reall allow for a strict enhancement of color with the ""standard, dynamic, movie, etc"" picture adjustments.As a result, we don't use it anymore. Will hold onto to it for now but will probably trash it if I can't get the color to a normal status.",2
Sm Sohelozzaman,Nice upgrade but Battery Killer!!,"We have enjoyed the upgrade from the last firestick we had, but boy does the remote drain batteries fast! Since we’ve been using it we have to switch out the batteries every 1-2 days! Not affordable and very frustrating. I have to use my app on the phone to use the firestick. Hoping they fix this very soon.",2
LaTrisha,Hard to Navigate,"My friend bought one and asked me to set it up. Some difficulty, but got it done. The one feature that does not work well is trying to get local channels. She asked for local news and gets channels 300 miles away. We downloaded a local channel and once we went to another channel we were unable to find it. Even the voice remote does not recognize it.Better than cable, but be prepared for disappointments. Also prepare for hundreds of Amazon ads.I like my Roku much better.",2
Danielle Roorbach,"Was inexpensive, but kept restarting after after a week","The software is easy to navigate, but it’s frustrating that it doesn’t actually migrate anything from other previous fire sticks. A better option would be to have all of your previous apps and info migrate over and ask which apps you’d like to kee/put on the new stick. Then, as stated in the title, the fire stick would constantly shut down and restart mid episode. I had to reset to factory settings and reinstall all the apps and passwords again. Not sure if this is a glitch in the programming or not. But I’ll wait and see if it does this again",2
Karen C. ,Hit or miss.,"Was fine for the first month, then it started closing randomly with an error message when streaming; the message advising to ""try again"". Sometimes you get sound but no picture. We verified it's not the TV; regular ""air/non-streaming"" channels are fine.  We're going to go back to Roku. We had a Roku device for over 7years and only went with the fire stick because a family member suggested giving it a try.  Roku works and you can get customer service when you need assistance. Amazon customer service is substandard. Half the time you cannot understand the person on the line and they don't seem to be able to find answers to tech issues. Very disappointed with product.",4
Bertha Howard,Poorly made device - buy a Roku,"The device integrates with the Amazon ecosystem nicely, but it is laggy, often takes several seconds to respond to a button press, and the “quick access” buttons on the remote changes the input (which it is NOT supposed to do) on my tv but does not launch the appropriate app. I was very sold on this for a LONG time, but when one device “bricked” (froze on “Amazon” logo, bought a Roku, and I learned what I’ve been missing. Roku is MUCH quicker, and I’ve yet to find something that Amazon offers that I can’t access on the Roku.If your internet connection is out or weak, you can’t even access things on your local network (like a NAS).",5
James Fox,Not worth it anymore,"I bought this to replace my old fire stick because it was glitchy and it was older so I figured it was time. I was thinking this would be an upgrade and honestly it was fine at first but a few months in the remote would drain batteries. So I thought maybe I should get better quality ones, so I did and nope still not working. They the back of the remote kept falling off so I taped the back of the remote.I constantly have to restart or unplug the actual stick because the screen will just go black at least once a week. This was just a huge waste, after years of being a Fire Stick customer I've decided to switch to something else, As the years pass the quality has gone to the toilet.",3
Sangeeta,Requires constant rebooting,"It needs a total power cut to turn on as the provided instructions to awaken a sleeping stick only works about 25% of the time. And then when it starts about 50% of the the time there is no sound requiring a power down second reboot. When using the YouTube app somehow Google is able to cram an advertising break in every 3 minutes, something that does not happen with other apps when playing YouTube. Maybe it is Amazon trying to get you to turn off YouTube and go to their Prime service.",2
Merrill,"Richest man, poor wuality product","On my third version.  If there was another source for this equipment, I would buy theirs.  For one of the richest men in the world, you’d think he could make a better quality product.  My first version kept being non responsive and I would have to unplug, remove the device connection from the tv and wait about a minute before plugging back in.  Sometimes, I would have to do this multiple times.  The second one just died all together.  On my third version now.  Unfortunately, there isn’t another source for the equipment.  If you want Amazon streaming, you have to purchase Amazon’s equipment.",2
Mark R. Wietstock,Fire Tv remote using 2 batteries per day,"Fire stick is easy to set up but the remote is using and insane amount of battery, like 2 per day. This is unacceptable, and I must return it. Batteries should last for at least 3 months.",2
juan martin cadenazzi,Preprogrammed Apps,"Hello,  It is infair that most of your customers are forced to keep apps we don't use. When one of the preprogrammed apps does not operate properly and all troubleshooting has been utilized,  then the stick needs to be Reset for a problem with one application. Case and point, Prime Video will not play on one of 3 of my fire sticks. It sucks that these unused apps have to consume space that other useful apps could use. When will Amazon install an update so that we can choose our own content??",2
Amazon Customer,Garbage.  I've had 2 of them STB this year,"I subscribe to DirecTV Stream, and I'm reasonably happy with it because of the breadth of their offering.  But Google isn't as big a fan of theirs since, presumably, it competes with their narrower YouTube TV. Because of that, the app isn't available on the Google Play Store for GoogleTV users.  So my otherwise wonderful NVIDIA Shield is a no-go.Enter Fire Stick.  It does allow you to download DirecTV Stream since it's not limited by Google's Walled Garden.  We've been happily using it on the TV my wife uses the most since earlier in the year.  We also got one for our home office TV.Over the last 2 weeks, the one in my office started freezing, shutting down, and denying access to the gear menu.  I finally had to just take it off and resort to casting to that tv.  Then the one my wife is using started throwing picture discoloration issues intermittently.  The whole screen takes on a magenta caste which can only be fixed by letting it rest for a few hours.Needless to say, these aren't good long-term options for streaming.  If one device failed I could chalk it up to a one-off.  But two of them, within 8 months, nope.Save your money and look elsewhere.",2
Joanne,Would not get again...very disappointed,I have purchased so many firesticks and this is by far the worse. I changed the battery thinking it was the battery and it would not work. It stopped and started working intermittently several times. I don't know what the problem is. I wouldn't get again. If this was my first time getting one and if I didn't have so many I would seriously contemplate another device. Very 🙁 unhappy.,2
Veronica jokerst,I like the stick but not the ads and commercials,"I find it funny when I watch conservative shows and news, Amazon likes showing male on male sex commercials and advertising lgbtq crap in front of my kids.  They have no parental locks to control their ads!  But I guess Amazon likes doing that and companies like fox news and newsmax really don't care where their revenue comes from.  Everyone is a bunch of hypocrites.",2
Jeremy McCoy,"Works well, not like watching live TV",Wish it flowed the way regular cable TV does and just goes on to the next video in line. I have a tendency to just leave my TV on for background noise but after each video I have to select a new one. Would be great to have a Playlist of shows that could be lined up to play on a loop like YouTube.,2
King Sora,Poor picture color,"What a huge disappointment this device is. I've had several peripherals connected to the TV: a DVR, DVD player, antenna for live tv, etc. Picture quality on my 65"" Samsung LED has always been excellent. With anything now streaming through the Fire TV stick, the colors are just off, and blah. So I'm not sure I want to even use it for anything. Where possible, I'm going back to the previous source of shows, such as accessing Netflix through the Smart TV App directly, not through Fire TV.",2
Amazon Customer,Super disappointing,"I bought the Roku express 4k and firestick 4k at the same time. I didn't know which was better  At first they both worked fine. Although the Roku was easier to set up. Now 2 months in, the firestick works maybe 30% of the time. The remote says I need new batteries every 2 days. Most of the time I have to stand within 2 ft of the sensor for it to register the remote. The voice control works sporadically. I'm debating whether to contact Amazon to try and fix it or just return it and get another Roku (I have had 0 problems with). Since canceling cable, streaming is all we do. When the firestick doesn't work, takes 15 times to try to turn on, change the batteries every other day or having to basically stand a foot away to get it work.....save your money and buy a Roku",2
Jordan ,Great at first but tired of them randomly restarting after owning them for more than a year,"I love my firestick and the apps I can use with it. I just hate that after a while they start randomly restarting while you are watching something.This will be my 3rd firestick with this issue since owning a first generation one.whats even more grating is customer service support solution usually ultimately amounts to ""factory resetting"" the device which erases ALL of your apps. I have over 15 different apps I regularly use and factory resseting the device and THEN having to input all my login info is a pain in the ass.They also STILL have yet to fix using the restart function and then It just freezes and stays on ""your fire TV stick is powering off"" until you unplug it.",4
Doris A. ,Terrible with Hulu live TV,I have 2 firesticks and a cube. I use Hulu live TV as my streaming service and it's consistently crashing on the Amazon devices. I have an android TV in my master bedroom and Hulu live TV works fine and never crashes. I'll force close and clear cache but live TV crashes too often for my taste.,5
Deybi valencia,Great way to stream - remote control is terrible,"Fire TV stick works well with my equipment though the Thursday night football is low resolution at times (maybe my Wi-Fi?). Only complaint is the awful remote control. The remote is too small and rounded on the edges so it slips around in your hand. Also, there is no backlighting (this should be standard on all modern TV remotes) and the buttons are not tactile. May try one of the replacement remotes.",3
Merrill,Great product normally.,I just could not get this one to work. I have had 2 others and I love them. This one for some reason would not work. Beats me. I will buy the same thing again tho it seems to go up in price. Now I am awaiting credit for it. Has been in transit back to the company now 7 days since I bought it? That long? I love Amazon. First glitch.,2

Ricardo Pinte,"Convenient Wireless, But Clunky, Sometimes Disappointing","It’s convenient to go wirelessly, but it can sometimes be clunky. It takes a good bit of exploring and trying connections to figure out how this works.An update. We have recently begun to have buffering problems. We can watch a program using the fire stick and it will begin buffering half a second at a time. It messes up the picture and the sound. A technician from our provider came to check out the problem and said it was a poor WiFi signal. But when I switch from the fire stick where we’re trying to watch NBC, for example, to Roku on the same set, and use the NBC app, avoiding the fire stick, the image and sound are smooth and synchronized. There’s no change in the WiFi signal strength. But the fire stick will not provide a good, steady image. Disappointing.",2

Stephanie R,Remote too small for senior citizens.,"Product was forced by our local cable company.  We are seniors and find the remote too small making the buttons hard to read.  Alexa claims channel (unable to find), 90% of the time.  Really?  Can't find NBC?  Remote  cheaply made, in my opinion: maybe because my previous remote had larger backlit buttons.  Fire stick, itself, works fine.",2
Ricky,Disappointed,This was to replace our older model Firestick that was beginning to have problems. The Firestick 4 has a problem communicating with with the Amazon Recast. Programs scheduled for recording do not record. Amazon is aware of the problem and supposedly are working on a fix. We replaced the Firestick 4 with our older unit. Beware of this issue if you have a Recast.,2
Amazon Customer,(Edited) Not ready for prime time - - Alexa on strike,"UPDATE 1/16/2022I contacted Amazon customer service about replacing this unit. Before I completed the transaction I decided to try the voice control, which had not worked even with tech support sharing my screen. To my great surprise Alexa is now working. I can only guess that another update remedy the problem. The rest of my review stands as is.I bought the 4K Firestick with Alexa as a Christmas season deal direct from Amazon. As a streaming device this fire stick is acceptable.Pros: It was easy to set up, including integration with my VPN and connectivity to my wifi. Channel selection is very good and streaming is smooth and consistent despite my remote location.Cons:1. The interface, compared with my Roku 3, is a little awkward. Some of that may be due to my not being used to the particular design of the interface. But trying to look at all my installed apps or to even tell which ones are installed and which ones are available is a little clumsy.2. *** Poor history tracking: it does not allow me to return where I left off very well. For instance, I was watching Eureka on Amazon Prime, first season. The title pops up correctly in my recently watched row, but every time I click to play, the interface reverts to season 5 episode 1, and I have to drill down to Seasons... Episodes...  figure out which episode I had left off at and select it.3. The screen timeout is abominably short. Every time I go to the bathroom or fix some tea, the screen goes to screensaver and I have to click through and say who's watching the fire stick and go to the channel I was watching and locate the episode. It's a little annoying.4. *** Alexa voice control from the Fire stick remote does not work. I get various error messages on the screen anytime I press the microphone button, all while the screen is telling me different suggestions for using Alexa. I have worked with tech support; they were very accommodating. They have shared my screen. We have updated my fire stick software. We have pressed all combination of different buttons at the same time and restarted the base; I've removed batteries from the remote, all to no avail. I have no voice control on my Alexa Firestick.The Firestick has a lot to recommend it, but this version is not ready for prime time.",2
Rhonda Metzgar,Fast forward terribly unintuitive,"Overall good product. Shortcomings come in the form of bad UI… of course, this is Amazon, so it’s to be expected at some level. The fast forward and rewind are terribly unintuitive. I’m sure more than 90% of the fire stick users would agree!  Good UI design should work easily, without screen prompts on how to do it.  Apple tends to get it right the most (but definitely not always)… also, to not have some of the fire sticks w a little more memory is a real problem. I would definitely pay for that. Have 2 fire sticks and one 4k fire stick in my home, so I feel understand some of their shortcomings well. I bought all 3 at heavily discounted times.",4
Merrill,REMOTE STOPPED FUNCTIONING 8 MONTHS IN...,WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,Still not Chromescast level,"It'd been awhile since I'd used a fire stick, but thought I'd give it a try when it went on deep discount. It's hard to say that it isn't worth what I paid for it, it probably is, but I won't be using it. It doesn't remember where I leave off in episodes. If I turn it off, and go back the next day to continue watching, it starts over. Additionally, telling Alexa to play something will typically bring up the newest episode in a series, not the episode I'm on which renders the voice functionality pretty useless. As someone that also uses Google Assistant, I can say this isn't what I expected or hoped for. Again, might this be worth it on a steep discount, probably, but if you already have a chromecast or roku player you probably won't want to make the switch",3
James F.,Buffers quite a bit.  🙁,It does what it says but buffers quite a bit quite often.,2

It was almost the same amount to buy a new fire stick as it was to replace the remote so I went with new. Well this remote totally just died I was using it and it just stopped working. It’s a rip off!!! The remotes are so expensive and they don’t even last 6 months. That’s garbage. Plus the remote is so small you can never find it. Very disappointed in this product.",2

BOGIEMAN,"Initially a hassle, fixed the issue, decent customer service","I ordered my 4k fire stick and it would not connect to any remotes; the one that came with it, my older gen remotes, I even tried the Fire TV remote app. So the fire stick was malfunctioned. I called customer service to get a replacement, and was told to return the fire stick only but keep all the cords and the remote that came with the package. I had a gut feeling that wasn’t right- why would I return only bits and pieces of something that’s considered one entire package. So I waited for the replacement to arrive before returning anything, good thing too because the replacement was the entire package as well just as I’d suspected. Then the second fire stick’s remote did not work either, but the first package’s remote, my old gen remotes, and Fire TV app did. So I am now using remote A and fire stick B and returned all the rest. Frustrating situation but I’m finally satisfied with it now at least. If you get all the necessary parts that actually WORK, it’s worth it. Beautiful 4k quality.",2

Melissa ,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 8 MONTHS,LOVED THIS WHEN IT FIRST ARRIVED.  SLOWLY GOT LESS AND LESS RESPONSIVE AND ITS A MAJOR FIGHT TO GET CHANNELS CHANGED OR TURN THE TV OFF.,2
atkinsbe4,Only one positive attribute,The only thing I like is being able to preview what the next 2 shows will be on any channel. I totally DISLIKE that I can not easily switch from one channel to another by entering channel numbers. It does not have any numbers on it. I despise my cable company for switching to only using this devise for me to watch TV. I do not use alexa. I refuse to talk to a machine. I am not that damn lazy! I am looking for alternatives.,2
jmc,Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls),"The Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with Alexa Voice Remote, has several technical issues, no encryption across the internet and very limited storage. Anyone has access to what you are watching across the internet and to your Wi-Fi network. No way to record and no way to add extra storage on the Fire TV 4k. I purchased a  OTG cable and flash drive, for the current Fire OS 6.2.9.1 but cannot use the extra storage for practical purposes and even when you load third party apps, which can see the flash drive but the Fire TV OS cannot or use it. The Alexa feature is lame, cannot perform have of the tasks you ask. I would get the Fire TV Stick 4K Max or the Fire TV Cube because of the version of Fire OS and storage  capabilities or by nothing at all",2
Frustrated,more work than expected to set up and Disney+ still does not work,"I have been using the firestick for about a month now.  I decided to purchase this firestick because my older, but still functioning Samsung smart TV is not receiving updated apps.  I had a good experience with Roku in the past, but was concerned about the tiff between YouTube and Roku. (Maybe resolved now)  So, based on good reviews, I decided to give the firestick a try.  Unlike various Amazon smart speakers we have purchased in the past, this firestick turned out to be much more challenging to set up.  Shortly after powering up, it seemed to ""hang"" receiving updates.  There was no opportunity to confirm the wifi settings were correct.  I tried moving much closer to the router, reset the firestick multiple times and was finally able to correctly enter my wifi settings.  Once I finally got it working, MOST of the streaming apps (Prime, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube) were a breeze to set up.  Disney+ has been a different story.  I have been trying, unsuccessfully, for a month to get it working.  The issue is some kind of communication error that pops up immediately upon launching the Disney+ app.  On rare occasions, I have made it to the Disney+ login screen, but got an error right after entering my email.  I have tried all of the suggestions I could find on the web- checking router settings, rebooting the router, rebooting the firestick, clearing the cache, uninstalling/reinstalling the app and resetting the firestick.  Nothing has worked.  Since all of my other streaming services are working perfectly, I conclude there is a flaw in the Disney+ app for this platform.  I notice the Disney+ software version ends in ""rc"", which indicates ""release candidate"" in software lingo.  If the software is not a full release version, no wonder it is buggy.  PLEASE can we get a software update to make this app more robust?  Overall, I would give the firestick 3 stars because most things do work great, except Disney+.  On the other hand, my older Roku (purchased for a different TV) worked right out of the box for all apps, including Disney+.  I am tempted to return the firestick and get another Roku, if the YouTube dispute is, indeed, resolved.",2

Charles Riley,Too many faulty apps 😒,"I plug the Firestick into the back of my Yamaha receiver, we can control the volume on our Yamaha receiver with this Firestick & ABSOLUTELY love that! We could not do that with our Roku Stick.Unfortunately, we've had to unplug this Firestick three times in the two weeks we've had it, just won't wake from sleep. Even more concerning are problematic channels. ""Xfinity Stream"" is unwatchable; we must watch that on one of the Rokus. Peacock & The CW are too slow & buufffeeeerrrrrriinng all the time. That's just three, there are more.Afraid will have to go back to the Roku. Really wanted to like this Firestick.",2

Annamous,Fire stck good ... lacking important features bad.,The Firestick is a convenient method for streaming. I own three. All three lack the ability to stay within the currently open app when doing a voice search. For example: I ask for Fox News on Alexa and it takes me OUT OF SLING and goes to  a Fox News App that requires a cable or satellite subscription id in order to connect. I pay Sling for this. I have to reenter Sling.,3

Ron,Remote control is very shoddy,When netflix connects its clear and works  Its the remote that has problems Theres no way to shut the firestick off' When you shut it off it shuts down the television.  The other buttons on the remote are difficult to constantly popping up stuff that you dont want. The remote is very small and hard to use. As far as that voice gizmo no matter what you say to it different things pop up,2

Last chance with this one then I’m done with amazon sticks completely. Can’t return them I didn’t think they would stop working a month or two later and threw all the boxes away:(I do not recommend then after three have suddenly just stopped working!,2
stephen r burnett,Inexpensive and easy to use,Use to stream at home because it’s a little faster than the interface on my smart tv,4
Tyler Roberts,Could be great if it wasn't so buggy.,"I bought this to fix my older Samsung TV's lack of speed when executing commands on native apps (esp HBOMAX). I was going to buy an Apple TV box, but decided it was too pricey.The Fire TV stick was the perfect solution and integrated seamlessly with my older TV. It was simple to set-up and use- plug, login, play, and go.Initially I was liking the product but after a few weeks of use, there are significant flaws you should be aware of:-Prime Video app doesn't load quickly, it somewhat stutters to load the graphics etc. (and it's not my 300G connection that's the problem).-Disney+ has not been working on the app for months now, it won't load or sign in properly. While this is probably a Disney+ app issue with Firesticks, I've never come across this issue on other platforms.-HBOMAX app is now not working properly, initially it was smooth sailing and way better than my TV app. However, now it's become buggy despite clearing cache, data, restarting etc.This device has been around for 4 years+ and somehow these types of bugs haven't been figured out, a bit of a disappointment. I'll end up getting an Apple TV or Roku to replace this stream stick",5
Dana Harmon,Some apps don't work. Frustrating,Apps like paramount plus and ESPN+ don't work. I'm not sure why this is despite resetting apps etc. etc. Disappointing for those reasons.,3
Hippie,It's ok....less than I expected,"Thought that I would be getting more free streaming (Hulu, Paramount etc) but it keeps asking for a subscription. I've bee using Freevee (Amazon) which has some good programming. Sometimes the picture is dark on streams from channels like Bee TV.",2
Scott Gubricky,No es posible que no tenga la aplicación de HBO MAX!!,"Yo soy un usuario de HBO Max y cómo fire stick no la tiene cargada, ni se la puede encontrar con búsqueda, tuve que descargar la app siguiendo un video de YouTube pirata!! La app al no ser nativa es mala en su funcionalidad, Alexa no la reconoce… muy mala experiencia con una plataforma muy importante como HBO MAX… mala calificación!",2
James Griffin,Good but watch out for ghost streaming/data usage,"Be careful of weird excessive data (internet) usage when using the Firestick.  I was a alerted by Xfinity via text that my internet data for the month of December was near it's limit and it was only mid-month (Dec 16th).  When I checked my Xfinity account, I double my internet data (see picture below) for the 1st 15 days of December compared to my average monthly usage.  I called Xfinity to see if I can get additional info since I can only view data usage by month and not at a daily view.  Xfinity stated that I used 500G OF INTERNET DATA in one day on Dec 15th.  They gave me some insight on what to look for on my (owned) router to find what device was the culprit.After looking at the router's performance/usage report, I found the MAC address that had HUGE usage which was the linked to the Amazon 4K Firestick.  I went to the TV that had the Firestick....the TV was off and it appears that the Firestick was not ""on"".  I blocked the Firestick's MAC address and monitored my internet usage and it appears I stopped my excessive data usage so I confirmed that device was my data hog.I looked online and there are some recent reports of Firesticks using excessive amounts of data when it goes into the screensaver mode.  Some of these reports were a few years old but some of the articles gave recommendations on how to fix it thru some settings which I implemented on the Firestick.  After unblocking this device, it now uses minimal data when not in use.  If anyone has answers to this issue or the reason for this excessive data, please reply to the excessive data issue in the question section of this product.  Thanks",2
Nick,Bad UI.,UI is messy and not user friendly compare to the one on Roku or Apple TV. I recommend Roku over Fire stick because of this issue.,2

Mark R. Wietstock,"Buyer beware, Remote sucks! Get extra warranty","It has been less than nine months since I got this fire TV and I’ve had more problems with the remote than I ever had with the older version. Remote not only eats battery life but it is continuously disconnecting and needing to reconnect to the fire TV and now after less than nine months it refuses to do anything it is completely dead, it will not reconnect, new batteries make zero difference and  even though it’s been less than a year it seems that they take no responsibility for this defective device.",2
Brenda E.,Resets,I don't understand why I have to constantly reset this remote.  I've never had to do this with previous firestick remotes.  It will work for a week but then it will stop connecting; then I will have to do the lengthy process of resetting the remote.  Its a bit frustrating.,2
Dustin McCormick,After 1 year the original Fire stick quit and I had to purchase a new on as the warranty was up.,I would prefer if you could have a keyboard and be abe to select what you want to view.,4
Jimmy S.,Streaming,"I bought the fire stick to improve my YouTube streaming and it did improve, but at a cost there are so many more commercials that I stopped using it.",5
Junior,"No more ""recently watched"" option","Fire stick used to be good. It still plays fine. But it is so hard to navigate and now the ""recently watched"" menu doesn't show what you have watched and shows other things that you've never watched. It is worthless. If you want to continue watching a series or movie from the night before you have to navigate through all of your saved items to find it and then search to find the right series and number. It used to be you could just pick up where you left off. Now you'd better write it down because fire stick will not remember it for you. Sad how they messed this up.",3
Tracy,FireTV remote 4k,I had to get another wireless speaker because the I had wouldn't work with new one,2
Jon B.,Sorry I upgraded,"I had an old 1st gen fire stick and decided to upgrade as it was having buffering issues with some of the higher throughput streaming services.  Other than that I had no real issues with the old stick.This new 4k stick comes with a host of problems unfortunately.  It doesn't have the buffering issue, but that is the only plus.  The newer menu is horrible, it brings the ads front and center and makes it hard to get to apps.  Even worse is their ""eco friendly low power mode""  9 times out of 10, when I go to turn on my TV and stick with the fire remote, the fire stick never wakes up out of sleep mode.  It doesn't respond to any button presses on the remote, not even Alexa.  The only way to get it to turn on is to unplug the power to force a hard reboot.  Amazon is aware of this issue that many people have reported, it apparently has to do with what TV you've paired with, but they are not interested in fixing it.  Sometimes when doing the hard reboot, the stick fails to have sound output, and you have to hard boot it again.If it weren't for the buffering issue on the old stick, I'd go back to it since it worked so much better.  Instead I think I'll switch out with a Roku stick instead.",2
Phillip Christain,Remote drains batteries in one day!,Overall streaming is amazing however unless you have an unlimited supply of batteries you I for trouble.  Even after receiving a replacement remote the same problem still exist. I’m genuinely statutory believe its because Alexa is always listening. There’s no other logical explanation. The only REMEMDY pair your old remote with the new fire stick.,2

Merrill,A few issues you should know,"I have a Roku Ultra. I bought this because I was not happy with the Amazon Music app on the Roku and thought by using Amazon's device it would fix the issue... It did not. It fixed 1 out of 2. The first problem was the Roku doesn't play in high res which is why I subscribed to Amazon Music in the first place. The Firestick fixed this. The second problem was that it wasn't gapless. The Firestick didn't fix that. To make it even worse, the UI was pretty much the same, terrible.  Both the android app and the desktop app are better. They do high res, gapless and have better UI, although it's still pretty abysmal. The last problem I had with it was with running it through a switch. I had run out of ports, so I bought a switch for another $50. When using the Firestick through it, there were dropouts. Little hiccups. Add to this, the fact that the Firestick only runs through wifi, no ethernet and the remote has no IR so my universal remote won't operate it and there is no advantage over the Roku I could fond at all. So, this has been a big waste of time and money. I wish Amazon was more clear about the limitations of their devices and software.",2
Mark R. Wietstock,Stick,I dislike that you can’t see any of the buttons in the dark. You have to put on the light to make any changes. Also it’s too small so I keep losing it.,2

miguel,Fire TV Stick 4K - No Dolby Atmos w/ Netflix!,"Product works partially as intended. Dolby Atmos is NOT supported on the Netflix app as this Fire TV Stick 4K runs on Fire OS 6 instead of Fire OS 7 as required to run Dolby Atmos on the Netflix app.Amazon has stated that they will not be updating this version of the Fire TV Stick to Fire OS 7.Even on Amazon Prime Video you have to dig into menus/settings just to get Dolby Atmos going. Personally I think it's a little clumsy and wished everything was a bit more straight forward and stated as such.I got my device during Prime Day ('22) and now wish I had known the facts I just stated ahead of time. I guess Fire TV 4K Max is the one to get, but of course.",3
dwight murr,Still evaluating This one?,"I’m still evaluating this device, this is my 4th upgrade for Fire stick. It is same as my previous unit with additional buttons on demand for prime video and netflix  Hulu etc.I’ve noticed that this unit seems to freeze up often so far I’ve had to restart it several times to gain functionality of it. Also it’s slower to load and access some apps.I’ve especially notice the the Peacock app freezes often where it didn’t on my former device. I’ve been told that it could be my internet system, which proves false because there isn’t  anything wrong With this service I have.Works great other than these issues.",2
pdr,"Remote eat battery too fast, constant discoloration","I thought a big brand like Amazon could offer a better quality product that fits their company image, but I was wrong! I listed Two major issues I experienced below so that you don't have to make the same mistake again.1 - The remote control eats the battery too fast. A new, good-quality battery only lasts one night! I Googled for a solution and restarted, and re-coupled the device, but it didn't work. Now I can use the universal remote control I bought separately.2 - Every few weeks, my TV screen becomes ""pale"". It's not a TV quality problem, because if I switch to other media sources, it works perfectly fine. The streaming device must be restarted, and probably the problem will be gone. This is so inconvenient!I bought 3 Fire devices during the last couple of years. The new one is the worst. I will not buy this product again.",2

Sometimes i can stop and restart and it will be synced but other times I have stopped and restarted multiple times and its still not synced. This happens on multiple apps. I have a different streaming device that i use as well and never have this problem so I 100% believe its due to the quality if the fire stick.

Very annoying - I tested the same apps on my PS4 and they do not flicker on the projector using the PS4.Did not have any issues with connectivity on the apps, including Disney+. Also, the 4k FireStick does work on tvs/projectors that do not support 4k.

There is a noticeable improvement in picture quality and the user interfaces have been upgraded.However, despite only owning the device for a few months, it's already frozen several times, requiring me to unplug the unit to reset it.  Further, it no longer goes to sleep by holding the home button.  If this is happening within the first few months then I am afraid how this device will perform in the next year or two.Also, the remote also doesn't feel as sturdy as prior remotes and the battery cover doesn't lock as securely into place.  I am hopeful that it will last.It is convenient for streaming but given this device has existed through several generations I would have expected better performance and fewer quirks this early in ownership.",2

Justin Paul Leasor,"Enjoying using it But,…","I’m enjoying using it but, all thing’s considered spend the extra $15 or $20 more and buy the Max which has the newer firmware. I’m a geek at heart and in some sick twisted way, I had fun watching a bunch of YouTube videos, setting  up a ftp on my laptop, backing up all the apps to it and then formatting the external usb stick transferring all the apps back onto the usb and reloading them as external on the firestick. Went from a gig free to 3.24 free. But it took me half a day. The two things I learned are that some apps don’t behave properly when moved to external memory and when it’s time to update an app that wasn’t written to be on external memory, it won’t update. You have to reinstall it and then uninstall it and move it to the usb again. The new firmware makes this a one click easy transition. And I have the feeling that the older stick will never get the full upgrade to the newer firmware  either because of some technical reason OR more likely because - They want to sell you the newer stick.Update - Other reviews complaining about ads and WiFi connection problems, turn off the ads and fix your bad WiFi. The stick can’t do it for you. And Yes the ONN Walmart device is $20 but it’s missing some features.",2

I don't necessarily it's the Firestick 4k's fault, but there are some things that you need to know before purchasing/upgrading to the 4k version.While I have terrific internet speed of 300mbps+, I have a 10 year old smart TV that itself isn't a 4k screen, and I'm sure has a slower processor.  Consequently, I don't get the benefits of the 4k on my TV. And that's ok.  But because of the older processor, the Firestick 4k is really slow to respond.  THAT'S ALL ON ME.If you buy this, make sure you have updated, fast equipment.  i'm not sure if the older Firestick is still available, but you should be pretty certain that your equipment will support this new Firestick's demands.",2

Amazon Customer,Remote stopped working after a few months. Otherwise 5 stars.,"Look. This is a very impressive product. It practically turns any TV with an HDMI port into a smart TV with access to most apps out there. The only problem I'm having with the Firestick is that thier remotes continue to fail, they just stop working. This is my second firestick in around 3 years, I only purchased this one cause the first one stopped working. Otherwise, it's def. 5 stars.",5
A. ferguson,Not very happy with my experience with the fire stick,My remotes stopped working after 2 weeks and I’ve got to keep repairing them and my bedroom one I have to be right on the tv for it to work,3

Robert,not good enough,strem quality not good,2
Dusty2,Ease of use,"When compared to the ROKU system, the Fire TV Stick 4K is not a ""plug and play"" device and is not as user friendly.  It is cumbersome to install with many steps.  In addition, once the ""Home Page"" is set it appears that options change each time the system is turned on.  Example:  I expect the streaming applications to show up in the same order every time I turn on the tv.  Unfortunately, each time I turn on the tv the listing displays the last application I used before I turned off the tv.  I then have to hunt for the application in the listings.  Very frustrating.  Bottom line: (1) Very cumbersome to operate. (2) Spend a lot of time trying to navigate around the applications when browsing through the various streaming platforms.",2
Lisa Whitley,Can do very little without a remote,"The only reason I bought this was coz I wanted a handsfree tv viewing experience.My Samsung smart TV has all apps and enables great streaming but I wanted to extend this experience by using voice commands. Unfortunately, it can do very little without a remote. It only makes sense to buy this when you do not have a smart TV or streaming device with you already",2
J M,The batteries were NOT included!,"The batteries were NOT included as it states in the booklet that came along with the device. I had to purchase some batteries.The device is nice but, it says it comes with batteries but it did NOT! And I am not finished going thru the initial stage of the first time usage!Where are my 2 AAA batteries?",2
DE,Pretty good but no Airplay Support,Bought this over Apple TV as it was cheaper.  Should have paid the extra for Apple TV as we are an all iOS house and this device doesn’t support Airplay.,2
Emma,Broken remote,Streams well video quality is great. If I can actually use my remote. Not sure if I got a defected one that seems to drain batteries. Need to work on their remotes seems to be a big problem with this generation of firestick.,2
Cindy Stump,Infuriating!!!,"I have 3 Fire Sticks - 2 of this model. I've had problems with varying features of ALL of them, but this last one has blown the top of my head off! It continues to change the TV it tries to control to a different TV that another Fire Stick is attached to. In other words, it changes from an LG TV to a non-existent Philips TV. Another Fire Stick controls a REAL Philips TV. I changed it back OVER AND OVER until I finally deleted the real TV (and the duplicate phantom TV it kept creating) out of Alexa to try and stop it from switching. NOW, if I'm lucky it will sometimes detect my actual TV but after I restart it, it's gone again. Most of the time it won't even detect it or it gives me a ""remote error"".I'm fairly certain that when I try to use the other Fire Stick that was attached to the TV I deleted that it won't work anymore either.I can't imagine buying another one of these EVER again! UUUUGH!Tech support was a JOKE!!!",2
Gerry Schilling,Ok,Voice & mouth are not in sync.,4

Leonardo Landi,It's Okay,"I got this to replace the Roku in my daughter's room (there wasn't anything wrong with the roku this was just on sale cheaper than a new remote) our whole house has always been Rokus and so far this is what I prefer.

Jacob K.,not impressed,lacking in things I wantedI will keep it...,2
Mary,Mostly great,"I love the streaming service, but a couple times a week when we turn on the TV, there's no signal coming from the stick and I have to reboot it. No big deal, only takes 30 seconds, but annoying.",2
richard h.,only had this for 6 months & it no longer holds a signal,"used for streaming & to only last for 6 months was totally disappointing! No longer holds signal on tv luckily I kept an old fire stick but can""t find the remote so I have no choice but to buy a new one.",2
Gabby,Kinda better but not really,"I didnt want to buy a new fire stick, but the original model I had kept crashing, saying no wifi signal- it was in the room with the router. So finally I got this version and miraculously it has had no trouble with finding the wifi signal. Yea, right? Nope. This fool has no sound everytime I turn it on. I literally have to reboot it everytime I want to use it or I have to lip read the screen. It is very annoying. Otherwise the stick works fine. The remote is annoying bc the whole back is the door for the batteries and it makes creaking noises everytime u press a button. Its a decent price, but you'll have to go beyond to get this device to function.",2
Ruben Belloso,Lacking Home theatre integration,"If you expect to install your Firestick into a HDMI port on your home theatre it may or may not work properly.  I don't believe the issue is with the AVR but with the FS integration.  It was hit or miss whether the FS would wake up when the AVR input was switched to the FS.  It would not wake up by pressing any of the buttons on the remote.  I had to depress Select and Play for 10 seconds to reset/reboot the FS.  Support suggested connecting directly to the TV which I did and use Bluetooth for Audio.  This is working but now I have another remote to deal with. Yes, I could probably spend the money on a universal remote to integrate all my equipment but why should I have too.  Amazon support was contacted twice on this issue.  First tech was not helpful, Second tech was great.  I also reached out to my AVR support and there stance was to point the finger back at Amazon.  Once again, the customer is caught in the middle.",2
Santos Matias Carrillo,It's okay,Disney + will not download now matter how many times we reset it. I'm not sure if my device is defective but it won't link up to the basic TV functions like power or volume control. We've followed the steps in the manual and it just won't  work. Overall streams well though.,2

Mimi lewis,Does not work with Disney Plus,"I have 3 FireTV sticks in my house that when purchased new a year ago streamed Disney Plus perfectly. But since some recent updates, none of them will stream Disney Plus any more. Just purchased a new 4K stick to see if that helped but it did not and I had to send it back. I can stream Disney on any of my computers so I know its not anything to do with my network.",4
ShopSurfer,Good,"I have bought four of them and I have had to return two for different reasons, one been that it would not play Amazon music, it would start the song and then it would start buffering, I bought another to replace it and that one is fine; The other one I return I don’t remember why.",5
Merrill,One remote did not pair with tv,I purchased 3 firesticks since our cable company uses internet now.  I could not get one of the remotes to work on any of the 3 tvs.  The other 2 worked great and I even changed the batteries to new ones.  I cannot get it to pair with any of the 3 tvs I have.  I did get my smart tv remote to work with the firestick but it is difficult to use the tv guide on that remote.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,How do you go back to regular TV?,"I think this is fine and I get to watch Discovery Plus on the tv, but when I am done I cannot figure out how to go back to my regular tv which is Dish DVR.  I think (not sure) that the SAT button on my remote is the way I got it back.  The second time I used the firestick that didn't work.  Not even sure what I finally did to get back to DISH.  So now I haven't used it since.  Too afraid that I will mess something up and not be able to get back to regular DISH.  Could have really lived without this based on all the trouble it takes to use it.",2

Not only that, when you try to close out the commercials, they have it set up in a way that it is very easy to accidentally add the programs to your watch list. Again...irritating. I pay for services so that I don't have to watch that stuff...",2
MtnBrookie,Fire Stice is quirky.,"I like the fire stick overall.  I like the assortment on channels and programs you can get.  I did away with satellite have subscribed to You Tube TV and like the service thus far and am saving about $75.00/month to boot.  However, Amazon needs to improve the operation and options.  Some of my suggestions would be as follows:1)  Fire Stick get stuck from time to time requiring it to be unplugged and that plugged back in.2)  Have read that you need to clear the Cache and memory every-so-often to keep the device from locking up.  But to do this, you have to go into each individual streaming app and clear it.  You cannot clear everything at once.3) if you hook up a Bluetooth device such as headphones, you cannot listen to the headphones and the TV speakers at the same time.  It would be nice to have the option to use the headphones and speakers at the same time.4) needs the ability to hook up a hard drive to the firestick to record programs.",2

Amazon tech support transfered me over to someone in ""Network"" support that informed me that I was having some kind of network issues that they could fix...All this news to me.  It ended up costing me an extra $149 for essentially some kind of network cleanup and monitoring for one year.  Not happy about this at allo Overall, the fire stick 4K is a great product with a great user intereface to add all the popular streaming Apps",2
Merrill,Great until the remote died,This isn't the first Firestick but the first since we cut cable. Nice interface with YouTube TV. Haven't really missed cable at all since we can get local channels as well. Had this FS 4k for about a month when the remote just died. Dead. Could not resuscitate even going through all the steps online and within the app. Customer Service was good and after just a few minutes realized this remote was dead and sent a replacement arriving 2 days later. Not thrilled that it was a refurbished model - I thought they should send a new one since the whole unit is barely a month into service.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Just ok.,I keep hoping that they fix these things. Every one I buy is glitchy. Problems like voice and mouth movement do not coincide. The menu icons just start moving in one direction un-controllably. The thing does not respond to input from remote. All of these issues require a restart which requires drilling down through the menu to find. I like the convenience of having all of my streaming on one device.,5

I would like to buy another, because I really like the way the one we have works, but not until I get some form of acknowledgement from Amazon",2
Richard Warner,can not control bluetooth device with fire stick remote,"This is my 2nd fire stick. I've been impressed with my 2nd gen fire stick but dropping it multiple times has taken its tole (buy a cover). A feature I've enjoyed is controlling the volume and mute, on my blue tooth head sets, via the fire stick remote, but i was sorely disappointed to find the my new ""Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device with latest Alexa Voice Remote (includes TV controls), Dolby Vision""  does not have this feature. Reading multiple reviews I've noticed many complaints it doesn't control blue tooth speaker either. So my assumption is that it does not control blue tooth devices at all. My older stick has software ver 7.2.7.3 and newer ver fire OS 6.2.8.7 . MAYBE AMAZON COULD DO A SOFTWARE UPDATE!!",2
C. Gene Hamilton,Work well EXCEPT..,"Amazon, you’re one of the biggest companies on the planet. Why is it so hard for you to get all your stuff to work together?

cinoromyxo,Won't work on Samsung 4k Smart TV,"I called support to help set this up, I even followed YouTube ""hacks"" all to attempt pairing the remote with the device. Eventually, after hours of irritation and arguing with tech support who knew nothing I tried to set it up on my 13"" Samsung TV from like 2011. All of the sudden, the remote paired and I could finally set this thing up. Once that was done, I had to plug it back in to my Samsung 4K TV, which should've been MORE compatible than the outdated TV, and then I could finally use it on that television. So,  if you can't get the remote to pair for the life of you and you've done everything that makes sense then try to use another TV for set up and attach it to the TV you want later.",2
Stephanie,Bought for an older TV,"I bought this for an older TV, and it worked but not as well as I had hoped. I got rid of the older TV and bought a new one with Amazon TV built in. So I returned the fire stick since I no longer needed it.",2
Brett Alexander,"Nice, but.... beware-","Whatever your watching,  no matter how far you've gotten into something like a 3 hour movie, be prepared for the stick to shutdown because Amazon arbitrarily decided that it was time to do a system update.

Time to look at other Android TV devices like the Dreamlink T2.",2
Merrill,Works very poorly in conjunction HUGHES Satellite internet,"I am a recent subscriber to Hughes Net Satellite internet. So I was looking forward to using Amazons Firestick for weekend entertainment opportunities. The firestick installed and updated flawlessly. So I went to watch a movie, nothing but buffering and a message stating that there was no internet connection or that it was very slow. I did all the tests and it was showing that it works perfectly, until you try watching a movie or live TV and then it once again displays slow or not connected to the internet. I contacted Hughes Net. The service support tried a couple of tricks but to no avail. I then got onto Hughes public forum and started reading how many people were experiencing the exact same problem. It appears Hughes Net does not tell anyone that you can't stream TV or Movies over there system as I later found out from some unnamed satellite guru who calmly berated me on , ""how stupid I was for trying to use a firestick with Hughes Net, I should have known better""  Well now I'm locked into a 1 year deal and a firestick that I can't use.",2

I unsuccessfully tried everything I knew to get it to work, and finally reluctantly purchased this “Firestick 4G”. To Amazon’s credit, it did give me a discount on my new purchase. My new firestick set up quite easily; is working well, and does not seem to get as hot as the old one did. However, it does not permit me to fully utilize the old hand control as a back-up to the new control. All the old control will do is turn the TV on/off and control and mute volume. In my opinion, Amazon’s firesticks should last as long or longer than the TV itself. Because my old firestick lasted less than thirty-four months, and the new “4G” will allow only one hand control to fully operate it, I am giving Amazon’s product a 3 for now.",3

The power cord on the new 4K is considerably shorter than the older firesticks and doesn’t reach the wall outlet below the tv if you want to hide the cord in a wall shield with all the other cords. VERY ANNOYING! I tried to use the cord from the old fire stick and it didn’t work properly. The 4K firestick kept on cutting out and restarting with the old cord. Can Amazon PLEASE make a new cord that is at least as long as the old one so it can be hidden in a wall shield and still reach the power outlet? PLEASE??,2

This would get the firestick to reboot, then everything would be fine until it happens again.  I am a stay at home senior, so I use the firestick a lot.

Robert C,Doesn’t work with older TVs,"Generally speaking, I love Amazon Firesticks and have used them for years on both my TVs. Recently, both first generation firesticks stopped working after a software update. There were trade-in offers on amazon.com so I traded in both, one for a regular Firestick and another for the 4K version (hoping it would still be useful if I upgraded my TV). The regular Firestick works well but the 4K version shows error messages on both TVs (HDCP error). Apparently (upon web searches for this) it seems older TVs are not licensed to display 4K content due to the new HDCP Regulations. So even though my TVs are 720p and 1080p the signal doesn’t work and  I had to return the 4K stick (losing my trade in discount in the process) and will have to wait to get it when I have a new TV.3 stars only because of the compatibility issue with older TVs but I am sure on a new TV this would be a 5 star device.",2

Also. this version has advertisement buttons across the bottom.  what's with that.  I mean you already have to put up with all kinds of ads on the TV.  definitely a step backwards.",2
Merrill,"Decent video, with crap tons of “featured content” in the way","Unfortunately, the fire sticks seem to be a way for Amazon to get you to pay for a device that lets them push more advertising (aka”featured content”) at you, while you just want to quickly see the apps you already pay for and the Amazon content you already pay to be able to watch.  Integration with other equipment, while the fire stick claimed is “complete”, is problematic. It swears I can use Alexia to turn on the attached blue ray player, and it shows the player is “activated”, but Alexia never can seem to understand what to do.  If Amazon would let me show all my personal apps in the top line of the Home Screen, and not have to wade through their junk ads, I’d be about 5star happy.",2

tinaleaman,Eh it's ok,"It does what it's suppose to do, but I have a huge gripe. Here we watch a lot of QVC and for some reason there is an icon that resembles the remote, and it never goes away. Amazon support blamed it on QVC which makes no sense, and they insisted I speak with them before further assistance. They connected with me QVC and Amazon hung up instead of staying on so I could prove it wasn't QVC. So Now I have to use 2 boxes for my TV. One from Comcast Plex for QVC, and Firestick for something else because Amazon as usual isn't very helpful, and they love to blame other companies for their shortcomings. They have pulled this kind of stuff with me before when buying game stuff that is shipped and sold by Amazon. I miss mom and pop stores.",2
Casey P. Janulaitis,Difficult to understand,Bought this product to replace expensive cable tv it is a little hard to get used to but much cheaper than cable,2
Tasha,Good but kind of pricey,"I have an lg smart tv that is compatible with most apps excepta few such as pbs kids, now it finally accepts HBO max so when someone gave this to be as a gift after my daughter broke my remote initially declined saying I just need a remote to change Chanels. My phone can turn into a remote but it doesn't always work right as Iv tried also I have a four year old who wants to things fast. The family member who gave this to me e assured me e it wasn't pricey so I decided to give itvago. It is as pretty easy to use remote which no is good be cc abuse my daughter can use it and there's as couple of extra apps it supports. Thats the pro, the con, it's small and can get lost easily.

Merrill,Recent update made watchlist disappeared,"It is amazing that recent Fire TV update made the watchlist menu disappeared. You can still add shows to a watchlist, but you just cannot show the watchlist. What a nice feature!!!Also, moving the menu bar to the middle of the screen is plain stupid. Fire TV being slow is already a problem. It will overshoot if you use the scroll button to move to the menu bar because of the delayed in  feedback. You have to hit the home button every time to access it. Also, most of the space on the menu is occupied by icons that I do not click, but the menu items that I use have disappeared.My most used features are recently watched and my list. But those are either hard to find or disappeared now. Thank you!!!",2

Jason Robert Young,Comporium needs revisions to their streaming. It lacks features for the price you pay.,The lettering size on the guide cannot be changed. Its too small.The yellow gold background  makes it almost impossible to read the white lettering.There is no way to return to last station..to toggle back and forth unless comporium did not advise me of same. Comporium streaming needs revisions.,2
Lyla Talcott,Pairing Remote Requires Software Update,"The Firestick 4k absolutely would not pair with the new 4k remote it was shipped with. The ONLY solution I came up with was to pair an old remote with the 4k so I could get to ""Home"". I noticed the Home screen was the old menus so i inztalled updates.After reboot, the menus were as expected and the remote immediately paired without me doing anything!I then unpaired the old remote since I need it for its Firestick",2

michael j butler,Bottom channel buttons reset firestick,"This firestick is a major improvement over my 2nd generation model. It doesn't pause or get the voice out of sync with the lips of the people talking. 5 star review so far.Now the bad: if I press the bottom channel buttons like Prime or Netflix, the device resets and I'm kicked out that HDMI port. I've updated the device multiple times. I would return it but I don't feel like entering all the account info again. The copy settings feature didn't work. 1 star for sloppy untested coding!3 star average for the entire device.",2
Weezie,Does pretty well once you get past the Amazon BS,"I have recently purchased the 4k and the 4k max.Good points are that it is pretty intuitive and the sound is great.  It will work and do the job.  I have two main issues.  First, the memory cache for an app have to be cleared when freezing up.  This should be an automatic process - or at least be able to be scheduled.  Yes, you can buy an app that does that.  Second, there should be an easy mode to get to your channels on your main tv app.  You have to jump through hoops to set this up.  Finally,  the top half of the main screen is for advertisements - Amazon pushing more things.  Annoying - just like Alexa.  Note that the main reason I got the MAX was for sound - Dolby Atmos - and it works great.",2

Timoth S.,Buffers on ESPN,"I bought the fire stick 4K because it was on sale and I wanted to watch ESPN. My Visio TV smart cast is junk. The picture is great but their software leaves a lot to desire. The fire stick works good for the most part but the reason I bought it was to watch ESPN, but also bypass Smart cast on Visio. When I am watching ESPN it constantly buffers. Also my older fire stick buffers I hooked up my old Roku stick and it does not buffer, nor does my computer. So it’s not my network causing the problem. I still haven’t been able to find out why.",2
KA,Way to difficult for the average person to program and download some apps,"I purchased the firestick recently to use for apps that are not in your lineup. There are way to many steps and the onscreen promps are not clear and you use terms and words that older folks do not understand [i.e . ' OPEN IN REPOSITORY ' the average user does not know theses things . I am happy with the speed of it and the remote is good . I have noticed that the rewind and fast forward functions do not work in higher speeds , after fast forwarding the picture freezes and does not return to the play mode. Basically happy with product just need to redo your downloading process . thanks",2
Frank Addison,Could be better,"I already have a configured Firestick, but I had to add Apps and log into all of them on my second Fire Stick. That was not cool. Once I have a ROKU set up, I don't need to reset each one I sign in to. Just log into Roku and it configures the new device. I like that I can connect to Alexa and search for programs. That is a huge plus.",2
James,Good,Seems like no matter type of battery used they die quickly in the remotes,2
Matt S,Works… mostly,"It’s a nice compact and easy way to stream content to my son’s TV, where I can set child specific options like content rating and screen time restrictions.  Needless to say he’s pumped!However, the OS is INCREDIBLY slow in response to control input and it seems to need to ‘reset’ often when switching between menus.  If I relied on it for my own streaming, I’d return it for that reason.  My Apple TV 4K works much smoother and I prefer it for my main TV streaming but the Fire stick is best for streaming to a kid’s room or if you want a more cost effective way to stream content.",2
Gregory M. Kimmelman,Vino defectuoso,"Vino defectuoso, hasta que dejó de funcionar, no sé si es pq lo Compré en oferta...",2
daemoncycler,Not great for home theater,"It suffers from continuous audio dropouts when plugged into a receiver. I had to fuss with it for over an hour before I finally got it to a state where it wouldn't do it. What I found was that the dropouts occur when the sound is set to either ""Auto"" or ""Dolby Digital Plus,"" and setting it to ""Dolby Digital"" seems to have fixed the issue (setting it to stereo also worked, but... gross). From my searching on the internet, this seems to be a problem inherent to the device itself, and not something that can or will be fixed with a firmware update (thanks, Amazon!).I've had one plugged directly into a different TV for a while with no issue. I'm thinking that Amazon is just kind of playing the odds that most people won't be using a receiver, so fixing the issue isn't worth the time/money. I mean, if 95% of your user base is happy, who cares about the other 5%, right?",4
Amazon Customer,Remote no longer works,One of the fire sticks I purchased  is great! The other one not so much. I have not had it long and the remote has stopped working. I can't find the receipt bc my husband went to the store for me so now I have to figure out what to do with it. I'm not too happy.,5
Kelly Black,It’s OK,"It does what it’s supposed to do. It’s not that different than my previous one that lasted two years, then just quit. Of course, I already went through ALL the troubleshooting stuff before I called tech and they insisted I go through it all again (or at least act like it).  Anyway, when it still didn’t work, they tried to tell me it was my TV.  Ummmmm….NO.  It wasn’t. They gave me 15% off a new firestick (only after I asked for a discount),  so I got this one. It’s OK. I don’t really need the specific buttons at the bottom for Prime, Netflix, Disney, and Hulu. That’s a little redundant and I don’t use Disney or Hulu. AND…..I don’t know WHY they insist on making the battery cover SO hard to get off.  I have to put rubber gloves on just to get that thing to slide down. We’ll see how long this one lasts.",3
Jeffrey S.,Messed up TV,"We exchanged our old firestick for this new one. With this one now we have to unplug the firestick and then plug it back in for it to register with the TV. Otherwise, it just shows ""no signal"". It is super frustrating that it sometimes works, but most of the time does not. I am not sure if we will exchange for a new one or a different version altogether. Why would the TV not recognize the new firestick?",2
Merrill,I like the firestick lite better,I have high speed internet and it’s very slow to stream and it didn’t come with any instructions or paperwork not satisfied with the 4K just yet maybe we’re too new at it but I knew how to work the lite version I had and it worked better just less storage. Not too happy with the upgraded version of the firestick.,2
Mark R. Wietstock,Controls to close together,"The control is working fine, I can't review voice or Alexa as I don't have them.My complaint is with the 'Home' button, too often I touch it in error and have to start from the beginning.Otherwise 5 stars!",2
Sean,Bought as an update to existing,"Seems to work as stated, but beware of Amazon set up proceder. At set up it stated my system not up to date, but it was really a hacker that wanted to sell me additional software items to clean my system and get my credit info and rob me blind. Amazon needs to work on there on line protection, these hacks looked bretty lagit. Sorry but after reading all the blogs about this it seems to happen quite a lot.",2
Zoltan,It does quickly,3.5/5starsMy remote dies quickly and I'm upset about it. Since June 2 I had to replace the batteries 4times and this last time I changed them. I didn't use the remote and just used my phone. The remote is already dead. Everything is great but the remote.,2
Denny B,Does not have all my streaming apps in the store,"It works fine.  The Alexa integration works.  I can view the front door camera.  But, it does not support all the streaming apps I use.  Can't get SpectrumTV or The Daily WIre.  Switched back to a Roku and all is good now.  I don't care what Amazon's politics are.  I just don't want them to limit my ability to use a product.  So, this thing gets moved to the guest room.  If I still had the box, I would have sent it back.",2
John,Slick product and useful voice recognition but broken functionality after software updates,"Works like a charm, 4K quality is real and noticeable between this one and a 720p ROKU. better interface for navigation than roku, much faster.Glitchy software though. I have to uninstall and install apps like ESPN, NFLX after the fire tv stick automatic updates, it is quite painful to have to install/uninstall all such streaming apps. Developers I hope you are testing your patch work because it simply isnt good enough. Lot of inconvenience here Hence the 3*",2
Tim Noe,Buffering issue,"The Firestick was easy to set up, but we had buffering issues while streaming that did not happen with the Roku we had previously.  We have ordered a Roku since the Firestick did not work as well with our internet.",2
Stephanie,I was surprised that the Fire Stick Box was Not Sealed.,I disliked the fact there wasn't any batteries included with it as stated on the box & the box it self had no seal .. fortunately though I had 2 AAA batteries at hand ..so no big deal just a slight disappointment,2
Amazon Customer,The Previous Version was Better,"This new version has slippery buttons, harder to get pattern recognition without looking at the buttons your pushing since they're bunched together as the older version had buttons in a configuration that was easy to memorize without constantly looking at the remote to make sure I'm pushing the correct button and not either muting the sound or completely exiting the App back to the home screen which is so annoying....just my opinion and hope it helps.",2
Walter G. Quesada,TV will never be the same,"When Youtube TV and Disney aren't squabbling over pricing, this is a good way to get streaming TV.The controls are not quite as intuitive as I would like, but once you find out how to navigate, you can pretty much find what you want. The voice integration is very accurate and usually helpful, if you know the movie name, actor, or network it's on. Ditto for sports events. My biggest complaint is adding a streaming service to the main menu is not intuitive, but it can be done. 5 stars for 4K video quality if your network can support it. Go ahead and get it. After buying one and using it a few weeks, I bought 2 more for all my TVs. I ditched my satellite provider (Dish Network) and never looked back.",4

Elizaida R. Ortiz,The xfinity app,"I have a Roku device also that works better with the xfinity streaming app. The Roku remote works just like the xfinity remote in that when I push the right arrow, it brings up a channel screen on the right while I can still see the program I am already watching. The Fire stick does not do the same. I have to use the return button to go back to the full channel window in order to change the channel. My only complaint, otherwise a nice product.",3

Very disappointed that Amazon changed the configuration so that it doesn't support this anymore.",2
Kathleen Bastian,Remote will NOT work with Fire TV Cube,"If you are buying this combo just for the remote control because the combo is sometimes on sale cheaper than the remote alone, don't waste your money.  As of today (2/17/2022), this remote will NOT be recognized by a Fire TV cube.  Amazon has known about this for months and their response is some canned reply about how to add a new remote.  Check the Amazon forum for their remotes to see all of the complaints lodged by other users.  I love Amazon and spend thousands of dollars there every year but they really dropped the ball on this and are ignoring their customer complaints.",2
Larry Muse,They have to be rebooted often.,"I like most things about it, but I gave it only 3 stars because I have to reboot it almost every day to be able to see certain channels such as AMC and Fox News. I have 5 fire sticks, so it can get annoying. I had to connect the ac plug on every one of them to its own power strip so all I have to do when it screws up is press the switch to off and turn it back on.",2

Great stuff.Turned it off, came back a different day, and got NO SIGNAL.Unplugged it, plugged it back it, NO SIGNAL.Okay, WTF? Repeated this procedure and GOT A SIGNAL. Watched shows, great stuff.UNFORTUNATELY this turned out to be THE WAY.Have to unplug and replug at least 3 to 7 times EVERY TIME I USE IT to get it to function. Even tried a different power block from something else. No joyRecently just started unplugging it when done to see if that helps, but haven't actually used it again since, so that result is pending.",2
Andy Chrost,Does not turn on reliably.,"Bought this to replace an older Fire Stick because I left the remote behind on vacation.  Buying a new, updated stick made more sense than buying a remote.  This new stick is definitely faster than the old stick but the @#$%^ thing doesn't reliably turn on when I hit the power button on the remote.  The TV and the AV receiver turn on every time but the stick sometimes requires 4 or 5 tries.  Very frustrating.  Oh yeah, the video and dialog are out of sync a lot.  I would not recommend this particular stick.",2

Amazon Customer,Buffering galore,"I like the firesticks; however, there needs to be something done to cut down on the amount of buffering.

s j.,Remote Control Issues,The fire stick is wonderful. My remote control has issues with battery drainage. We are going through 2 batteries each day. Totally not affordable.,2
Jack Dharma,Built in outdating,I have bought 4 Firesticks and 2 of them had to be returned after spending hour with tech to get them to work and ended up having to return both. Replacements both worked instantly out of the box so evidently they send you the good ones only after they waste your time the 1st go around. The voice command doesn't appear to understand English either as is Constantly comes back with the wrong results.,2
Samantha Hunt,questionable data efficiency?,"I have many streaming devices, from original Chromecasts, to 4k FireSticks/TV, Roku, PS/Xbox, 4k blu-ray players...etc. I wanted to try this stick to see if the quality was better than my Xbox One X for overall streaming. (as Amazon Music HD is limited on the Xbox app, and I'm running a very high resolution 7.4.4 system) The picture looks good, possibly better than the Xbox1X feed, but the overall audio seems more compressed, and Amazon Music HD seems to not assess the device capability correctly (always 16bit, rather than 24 bit). So without add'l info gathering, I'm going to assume this stick isn't passing audio content in the most efficient manner, or is slightly limiting the throughput - granted, it is a wifi-connection over the ethernet connection (Xbox1X), but it is sitting next to the router, and I have consistent, ~900+mbps wifi throughput.",2

Darren a young,Same flaw at time of power-on,"We were hoping this new remote would not have the same problem as previously.  That is when tv is turned on during the day to the same station the fire stick automatically continues to show the same segment from two hours ago (recorded by the system?).  Once the user recognizes this, they have to change channel and come back to get the current live program, in the case of a newscast.  Alexa doesn't offer any solution.  Very annoying.",2
Kathy Pierce,Maybe better than a Roku,Bought one for the living room TV and one for the playroom. The setup is straightforward and overall experience is polished. These replaced a Roku 4200 and Roku Express because neither worked with Disney plus. The remote is almost identical but a little lighter though it feels good in the hand. I like that the remote can control the TV power and volume so I don't have to use 2. My biggest gripes are that prime video and voice recognition don't work on kids accounts. I tried giving the kids a regular account but it's too easy for them to sign up for premium subscriptions and purchase episodes without knowing.,2

When the projector is off, it's off.  When the projector is on, ass i can hear is what I'm watching.",2
Vodidly,WEAK ANTENNA,I have used ROKU and have not had problems with the internet.  I used the Fire Stick to replace the ROKU and it continuously had to buffer.  I moved the Fire Stick to a different TV that is a few feet closer to the router and have no problems.  Unfortunately I cannot move the larger TV so I cannot use the Fire on TV I purchased it for.,2

Summerhill Loon,Ok but prepare for 'planned obsolescence' later,"I like fire sticks when they are new but a year or two later you will have to buy new ones. They slow down to a point where they are unusable and you have to buy new ones. No device should be irrelevant in that short of a time ,and if it is,  must be engineered to fail.

I have to unplug it before I turn the TV on for it to work.  I tried turning off hdmi cec and a different HDMI port, but it should be working perfectly out of the box. I did not call support because I shouldn't have to try more ports when my last firestick worked in the original port I plugged it into. I'll be returning it for another.

R,Doesn't work if your TV isn't new. Needs new 4K to work. TV NEEDS TO BE NEW TO WORK,Wish I had known about 4K streaming and needing a new TV to watch 4K. If your TV isn't new it wont work. The new 4K the firestick uses isn't compatible with TVs that don't have the new 2.2,3
BS,Erratic operations,"This is the second Firestick I’ve purchased in the last two years.  Both have generally worked wel but the first one started ‘dropping’ reception on a few channels and, rather than trying to fix it, I bought another as they are cheap.  Well, right out of the box - after an hour or so setup - the new one did the same thing on the same channel.  I both searched Amazon and Google Q&A and have not been able to fix the problem.  Other than that, picture quality is fine, sound is good but not great, and I haven’t finished linking it to Alexa.",3
Peter B.,Remote would not link. No help with multiple chats. Phone calls were dropped.,Remote would not link to Fire stick. Chats were no help. Amazon help suggestions didn’t work. Three phone calls on two consecutive days were dropped.,3
Julian,Cannot disable HDR,"It works like you would expect it to, except there is no way to turn the HDR off. You have to buy the latest model for that feature, which I wish I had known. Would have spent the extra $25 dollars, HDR hurts my wife’s eyes.",3
dennis putnel,UPDATE — TOO MANY UPDATES IN A MONTH 😡,"I had just updated the current version yesterday, and today 8/26/22 I had to do the same. What is up with this product?!Are y’all trying to lose customers with Fire Stick TV and have us go to another route — Apple TV ?! 🤔 Let us know. Cause this ain’t it. It’s annoying. It’s crazy. It’s unnecessary. Get it together please! Thank you!",3
Lynsi Harris,Works well but not without flaw,"Got one of these 4k sticks as an upgrade for the family room TV then another for a new bedroom TV Santa brought this Christmas. They've worked well but today I figured out why while steaming live TV on Hulu, the app suddenly closes sometimes, and I have to reopen it and restart my show. I discovered that this only happens when I use the green Hulu button on the fire stick remote, not when I open the Hulu app from the fire stick home screen. So they lose the stars because the buttons, at least the Hulu one, doesn't really work.",3
kurt Emilaire,A good Android Box for the money,This is meant to be used as a platform for the Prime Video App.After reducing adds and tracking as much as possible- I was able to add KODI and other apps.After frustration with 'no sound at times' [common problem] - was able to find solution- HDMI inputs.Their 'Dolby Digital Plus ' is not as good as Dolby 5.1.1 Surround sound- but no option.Overall- for the money - this is a good Android Box and good platform for Prime Video- if you pay the monthly fee.,3
Merrill,Requires stronger internet signal,"I upgraded my fire stick lite to this 4k stick including tv control, but I returned it on the second day.I believe this fire stick is excellent, but does not match with my devices.It can't control my projector tv, which is understandable. It can't control my unknown brand sound bar, which is acceptable. I connected to my sound bar via Bluetooth, but still can't control volum. But it requires stronger internet signal which I can't offer. My fire stick lite works perfect with 1080 movie video. But this 4k stick is loading way too slow to watch anything.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,final judgement pending,"Purchase specifically to use the Pure Flix app on my Visio TV. I have been experiencing numerous screen lockups during programs (on Pureflix).

Dimitris,Remote,"BATTERY DRAINS FAST ,1 DAY TOPS.",4
Jim W.,Not Always User Friendly,"I seem to be able to log in to many formats  using the Firestick. However, I do find that it is not user friendly. I cannot always find ""free"" programming and somehow I ordered a children's movie (Peppa Pig's Birthday) on Amazon by mistake. Still not sure how I did this. I was able to cancel the order using my Amazon account that it was charged to.",5

T. Peterson,They last a couple of months,"I've really gotten used to and like the Fire stick set-up on the TV.  Sadly, I can't get the sticks to last more than a couple of months each.  It's starting to get too expensive to stay with it.  Cost vs. Value - I'm about ready to make a switch.",3
Mike M.,That I get my orders on time at my door.,I liked when I called for help regarding my new Fire Stick installing and the Rep. Lady from Amazon was so patience knowledgeable and kind.Thank you again Ms. Rep. Lady.,3
Cindy,quit working at the 1 year mark,"I love the FireTV firestick 4K. BUT...it just quit working properly right at the 1 year mark. Every time I would go to the tv's ""input"" firestick was not listed so I had to unplug it from the wall for a few minutes then plug it back in and it would be listed in the Input list. Well, this got really old real fast! I just purchase a new one. We shall see! (Feb. 2021 to Feb 2022)",3
Mary Darby,Not what I expected,"I was floored by the choices that were mostly only available at an additional cost. I already have Netflix, and this thing knocked that right offline and it took me forever to get it working again. The menu is difficult to understand, and the minimal controls have to be memorized. Not worth the effort unless this is your only source of entertainment. I would never use Alexa or voice recognition because they don't do well with accents, so that's all just unnecessary fluff, as far as I'm concerned.",3
RBurgie,more ads than Roku,can't figure out how to remove shows from 'continue watching',3

Mark R. Wietstock,New Fire TV Stick 4k,"This is my 4th fire tv stick.  I am pleased with Amazon's products, but I cannot see any difference in this version from the prior one I own.  The only difference I can see is the buttons on the remote: a big blue button replaced the microphone and buttons for 4 streaming services were added.  I purchased this new 4k one because I have a Vizio 4k Smartcast tv.",3
John,Remote should be backlit,"A small remote with no lights is impossible to use in a dimly lit room. After all the upgrades, you would think backlighting on the remote would be one of them.",3
Tammy Savini,More buffering than my previous Fire Stick,"I like the new remote control with volume on it as well as buttons for Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+.  I'm not a big Alexa user so that means nothing to me.  BUT I notice quite a bit of buffering, much more than my previous stick.  I'm wondering if it's resolution related.",4

Kelly,Quality of Amazon products are declining,When it works it works good.But the last one we had stopped working. So we got a new one. And half the streaming apps don't even work half the time. Keep having to unplug it and plug it back in to work.The last one we had for a couple of years with no issues until the end. This new one doesn't seem to work consistently.,3

Amazon Customer,Responsive and Video Quality very good.,"All in All a good streaming device.But: 1) I don't use Alexa and do NOT want it.2) I don't like the movie trailers starting even after I went to settings and turned off auto start.3) I just want to see a pause picture without the info about the show I am watching it. Netflix's is the worst at this however, Prime Video is less intrusive.This version of Fire Stick TV is very responsive compare to the first one Fire Stick TV that was given to me. The picture quality is good.",3
"Rocky, Aquia Va.",Has issues,"Over, when I finally get it to turn on it works great.  Not happy about having to unplug and plug back in the fire stick each time I use it.  The video and audio is excellent.  The remote works great and the buttons are in intuitive locations so I don’t even have to look at the remote.  There has got to be a way to turn this thing on without having to unplug it each time.",3
Merrill,Underwhelming app updates,I've been using it for awhile and I have to say besides Prime Video which is obviously prioritize by Amazon none of the other apps got updates automatically (Yes I have that option turned on). This is really disappointing because usually important apps like YouTube or HBO Max have bugs and become laggy.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Nothing To Write Home About,"This is my 4th Firestick. They seem to have very short shelf lives. I like that this version has shortcut buttons on the remote for apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I’m just disappointed that my data wasn’t transferred to the new stick, something I was prompted to agree to as I made my purchase. It was pretty annoying to have to reenter all my email/passwords. The remote is still very small and very easy to lose. The quality of the picture has improved though. Time will tell whether the streaming will be seamless.",3
Ionut Kuhls,Additional steps needed if kids in the home,"Warning, if you have placed a restriction on your account for purchases to require a PIN number, that requirement won’t transfer to this device. Our 6 year old granddaughter was able to make purchases with this remote even though we had a PIN required on our account. You must enable Parental controls after setting up the remote to avoid this problem!!!",3
BUTTONS ,good but,"I like the concept, hookup was easy. Setup was more difficult, on-screen instructions were difficult to read & I have a 55"" tv. The symbols were near imposable to read, way too small, I had to keep walking up to screen to make them out. This defiantly needs to be fixed! The unit also keeps losing my internet signal & is difficult to regain, needing to resign-in.The system itself works great and gives many choices, voice control does not always understand search requests.",3
Amazon Customer,Not 100% good,"It power's down in the middle of a show sometimes.  I know it's not my wifi because i can hear my husbands still going in the other room.  Of course, the return window was gone when it started doing this.  I think it was defective when sold and they knew it was.",4
Candice J. Chinn,Great remote which sometimes changes the resolution improperly,"The 4k fire stick is a great, quality device at a great price. However, we have an older TV currently which sometimes causes the fire stick to display the wrong screen size",5
Rick65,Long time Firestick user,"Firestick is great when it works, but all too frequently it requires a restart. Restart is no big deal - only takes a couple of minutes to complete, but it is annoying to have to restart so frequently. If I don't restart, I get the spinning wheel of death and it takes forever for a channel to launch, if it ever launches. For me, this happens most often when after choosing YouTubeTV from the main menu. If there's a permanent fix for this problem, I'd love to hear it.",3
Hub,Works,"I was pleased to pair the remote with a recent LG TV without too much trouble. Set up was pretty simple, but quite time-consuming. Frustratingly, toggling between Fire and Satellite inputs requires using all 3 remotes, that's way too much hassle. Works better overall than my old Amazon Fire system. The lack of a lighted remote is unacceptable. EVERY remote should have backlit buttons.",3
Vincent DiBona,Inferior video resolution compared to Roku with the same capability,I do not like the resolution of the video picture. Its very inferior to Roku. I installed this fire stick  on the same TV where my Roku device was.,3

Joan keller,Daughter-in-law talked me into.,A lot of trouble just to get to watch Bosch Legacy.,3
Paul Copple,Great until…,Got the firestick a few weeks ago and loved how much control over the content I get with it! I can control what my kids watch and how much they watch: perfect!But… only a couple weeks after we got it the remote simply stopped working!!!I called Amazon and was able to get a replacement phone that took several days to arrive but I am now concerned it the stick is just too good to be true and is in fact a lemon! I was planning to get another one as a gift for Christmas but I am just unsure about it now…,3
Merrill,I'm not really sure,"So far, the stick has been really easy to use and actually a lot of fun. Why the tree stars? I'm not actually 100% sure, but I think the stick messed up my cable. Right after I used the stick for the first time, I noticed my cable channels were screwing up. They become distorted and the sound quality is poor. I went online to see if anyone else had experienced the same problems, and I couldn't find nary a one.  Ya, I said nary, you got a problem wit dat? I didn't think so! Seriously, if anyone has experienced a similar problem with the stick, let me know.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Not so good,Remote is cheap and crappie. The tv is weak,3

Thundersub Blue Noah,Menu option on remote doesn’t work,Everything works fine except the menu bars on the remote doesn’t work,3
Amazon Customer,Amazon employee was a idiot. Run around.,Had to make two request and the second Amazon person I chatted with said he’d read the previous chat but then started a 20 question chat of which I refused. Not customer friendly at all before pissing me off. The item stops working in the middle of programming  I never had a problem with 2 older ones before this better than ever one. It’s not as good as past one I had.,3
Rachel L,Loved the previous remote!,"They ruined the remote by adding Alexa and taking away the microphone button. We have Alexa devices all over our house, we didn’t need it in our remote as well.The previous remote allowed you to search and type login and password information using your voice with the mic button. Once they changed the mic button to Alexa that capability was removed. Now you’re back to scrolling through the alphabet to input data. #Boooo",3
RichieRich,Setting up process is garbage.,"It took a while to get set up. Then it just shut down. No reason why. We had already done the whole “downloading latest software” process, restart and then installing the software. That’s when it shut down and it wouldn’t come back up. So I unplugged it and it’s doing the same steps all over again. This is pretty annoying compared to Roku. Also, The HDMI and power cords are way too short. I will return this item. I can’t rearrange my whole room for this one device.",4
Calvin Grant,FireStick will save me some money,"I like the FireStick, but don’t see me getting rid of my other service providers i.e. (Internet provide and regular cable TV service).  I can’t watch my favorite regular TV channel or say watch the ‘current’ HGTV program.  This is the down fall of the FireStick.",5
SRC,Streaming is great; Bluetooth connection isn't,"The streaming works fine:  brilliantly clear picture; haven't seen any buffering so far (weeks). But I often watch late at night and use Bluetooth for the sound.  Cuts in and out, where other sources, eg, iPhone, are clear and steady.  Annoying",3

Merrill,remote has issues from day one,Would get 5 stars but the remote stops working saying batteries are low even with brand new batteries in it..this happens every time I try using the remote and I keep replacing them even though the batteries work just fine in any other remote with no issues.. Other than that everything else is great..,3
Mark R. Wietstock,"An improvement over the one it replaced, but…","I’m not sure the new device is the blame, but it seems to have a mind of its own and switches to different feeds within an app. MSNBC is impossible to watch the choice you’ve made. Today I was watching Fox Sports, and it switched to MSNBC.There also seems to be a really aggravating thing happening with Amazon’s feed. Commercials come on at an extremely loud volume. I’ve activated the noise leveling to no avail. This seemed to begin with this updated Stick. Is it the stick or is it Amazon?",3
N. VanWingerden,Super fast,The 4k picture isn't impressive. The detail is there but the colors seem washed out. I have adjusted settings on both tv and the stick. Don't k ow which one is at fault. Other than that issue the stick is way better than regular stick.,3

Wayne Larson,Not working as well as my older fire sticks,"I’ve been using fire sticks for five years and love them so I decided to get the newest versions with the automatic buttons on the bottom for Netflix, Hulu, etc. I now have to restart my fire stick at least once every two days or there are problems with shows not playing and continually buffering. My Wi-Fi is connected perfectly and restarting is the only thing that seems to help for a while. Very disappointed!",3
Richard Duncan,When it works it's great! Often stalls and has to be replugged.,We have several Fire Sticks and we generally like them. Here lately we've discovered a problem with their just locking up. Everything stops and you have to unplug the fire stick and plug it back in and everything's fine again. Anyone else having this issue?,3
Pete G,I have to unplug all the time,"I have 2 Fire sticks.And with both I have issue at the start up.  But other than that I love them after we pass that hurdle of powering on.  One issue is no volume at the start the other has issues of just not Turning on with the remote.  The only fix for both is unplugging the power cable and waiting 10secs and connecting again. Sometimes I have to do it several times which is frustrating.  But as soon as it is working,  I absolutely love them.",4
Leland Midgett,Fire sticks just don't work well with Hulu!,I decided to upgrade to this firestick to see if it would work better with my hulu live subscription and it is a little better but it's not even close to as good as my little $25 roku express! I have always blamed Hulu for the glitching but it seems like it is Hulu with the use of Firesticks! Definitely dissapointing!,5

Christopher Nash,Marvelous but lacks effective screencasting capability,"This is a fantastic product, easy to install and use.

walfrido,Good product getting better,It has a lot of channels but it doesn't have DVR  capabilities and it cuts in and out often witch gets really frustrating when trying to watch the news but it works great when watching Netflix or Prime and it offers a lot of selection.,4
lightnin,Definitely ain’t for monitors,"I got this thing to try it with my monitor but unfortunately since my monitor is Lenovo I can’t select that brand on the fire stick. Because of the fire stick not having this option, I cannot change volume or use the power button to turn it off. Fortunately my sound bar can control volume manually and to turn it into sleep mode for the stick you just have to hold down the home button and select sleep. Works fine overall I guess but it should be more compatible.",5
Sharon,Doesn't always work,There were days and or nights this device did not work. Troubleshooting was difficult as there was not enough information. If the app does not work you can't get any information to fix the app. When working yes it works well. I would prefer not to have Alexa included in this but I don't use that at all.,3
Merrill,Difficult,It has been difficult learning how to use it. Slow progress.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Same generation different quality?,"I have a 4k firestick already and only bought this for the remote cause mine stopped working. For some odd reason this one is slow. The home screen is like waiting for a website to load slowly. My other other , I'd turn it on and was ready to go right away. Voice command just does random things sometimes . Ask for a show and it takes me to a place the show isn't on. Really can't understand how same generation same model can be so different .",3

Maddie Boyd,it is complicated to know,"We bought this to view 1883, which through some thought we finally got to watch first two episodes, but need something showing what else we can watch.  I am not a wizard at this, but what do I do to watch other movies.  Netlix when I go there it shows where to go,  this does not.  I only watch Paramount on this because everything costs.",3
Maria Huffman,Glitchy,"We decided to try one after being exclusively Roku people.There are some great features but it's so glitchy.  It constantly had to be reset or unplugged.  The sound was constantly going out for no reason.  It would change the ""input"" setting on our Vizio TV at random (and multiple times a day).We are going back to Roku.",3
Jan&Mom,Difficult to Install,My daughter who has advanced computer skills installed this for me on my LG smart tv.It took awhile to install.  You have to keep the Firestick remote near your tv remote to run this.  Reviewing or restarting a program is awkward and requires a back and forth between the tv remote and the Firestick remote.  I had to get this or a comparable version to run HBO MAX because my tv is 5 years old.,3

David Beltrán,Good Streamer,Ordered this one to replace an older fire stick. Had some setup issues. Had to do a factory reset to get it to work correctly.  UI is not the best. I prefer the Roku platform as it much easier to use.  I feel like I’m scrolling forever to find something.,3

Allison Ottosen,Freezes when using Xfinity app,"I use is mostly for Xfinity streaming to eliminate my cable box .  The only negative I get is the screen freezes up at times, may last for 30 seconds, then program jumps ahead.  This does not happen very often, but it does get annoying.",3
Patti Golliher,Not what I thought,Not everything I thought it would be. According to internet searches and info I have read about that would come with the fire stick is not very accurate.  You need to have paid subscriptions to more channels that are advertised as full viewing on the reviews.  Grrr.,3

Month and then the remote unpaired to the firestick and after numerous tries to fix via help sites Amazon said they would replace it, only trouble is "" They only sent a new stick "" and of course the remote wouldn't pair with it.

atif aral,Streaming paid channels are ok but not good for screen sharing,I didn't like that much because I can't screen sharing my Android phone with it.

Annie,Poor Build quality,I have 1st generation fire tv stick and its build quality is good. Recently I upgraded to this one but its build quality of this one is very poor. The remote makes crackle sound when I press any button.,3
J. Fleming,price too high,I bought 2 of these and paid 49.99 each - total over 100.00 and about 4 days later i bought 1 more at 26.74 (1/2 the price - it sure would be nice to get a 50.00 credit on my credit card for these two since it was not even a week had gone by and they were 1/2 the price.,3

Jorge Vigil,Unit quits working when it gets warm.,Unit quits working when it gets warm. And that is when you are in the middle of a football game or something else you really want to see. You have to remove the stick and put it in the freezer for 10 minutes.,5

Malena,Stream Quality: Video freezes and Audio plays normal,"It crashes sometimes and starts to play audio while the video gets stuck, at first I thought it was the apps problem but it will do this across all the apps. I can turn it off and back on but it loads up the same thing unless I unplug the fire stick from the power outlet.",3

Merrill,Works fine once able to turn on,"I don't use the voice control.  The only problem I have is in turning it on.

Doyle A.,Silly Buttons,"Everything is great with this remote except for the silly buttons that Amazon is renting to Netflix, Disney and Hulu.

Deirdre Godsey,Ok,Works same as old ones but crashes conatantly,3
Andy,Has issues with flickering and going dark.,The firestick started flickering and picture going darker after about a week.  Can't seem to find a fix that works.  Alexa works great with it.

Howard L Harris,"Works flawless, gripe with the remote","If you’ve ever owned a Fire Stick, you should know what to expect. This newer generation is a bit faster I’ve noticed. If you haven’t owned one before - I highly recommend. It’s fairly priced, they work wonderful, and they’re lightning fast. The UI pops up quickly with little input lag.I did run into an issue though, with this generation over the older. The new remote is a bit more user friendly with bigger buttons, which is great. The battery cover, however, is annoyingly loose. Like slides around in your hand loose. It’s not just inconvenient, but worrisome. I’d be very upset if it just slides off and gets lost to the void.I do recommend it, but there seems to be a quality issue with the remote.",3
Amazon Customer,High initial failure rate... but works well,"Recently cut the cable and converted TVs to firesticks. Bought a total of 7 firesticks... 4 at Best Buy for full price ($49.99) and then 3 more on Amazon for $24.99 ea ... 2 of 4 Best buy purchased firesticks failed upon installation (Which they were great about replacing), but it was a hassle. Also note that you can buy firesticks already linked to your Prime account on Amazon (kinda cool and saves on installation time) but they limited me to buying 3 at a time (for some bizarre reason).  One final pet peeve - Firesticks always startup on their homepage... so if you are like me and kept basic cable (for local channels), you always have to scroll thru all the preloaded apps to find the one your local provider uses -- PITA and lots of wasted effort. System should start you up where you left off.",3
CmeGruven,"good picture, quite a bundle for the price!","Pros:good picture, expandable with USB add-ons, and Android's tools.Cons:it complains if it ""can't see the remote"", no apparent method to backup the passwords or settings for the times when it has to be replaced, VERY difficult to save signal to external USB drives for archiving/later viewing, no timer mechanism for capturing future capturing when you can't be home to watch it, VERY irritating time-outs that we cannot vary or turn off (especially annoying), no obvious EPG functionality, commercials are getting more frequent which is especially ANNOYING, and Android's tools with their limited functionality and scope.",4
matt craft,Losing its Mind,"Over the years, we've ""settled down"" between the myriad brands (Apple, Roku, etc.) and enjoy and depend on the Firesticks. They're reliable and inexpensive. I will say though, that this recent one consistently ""goes to the wrong place"" when choosing something we're already watching or when ""switching"" to another vendor (HBO, APPLY, HULU) through the Fire-stick portal. For example, no matter what HBO show you choose, it will always go to the start of one specific show, and it's a small circus of ""back and forth"" on the remote to get it to the right place. Often shows will go to a season two years past rather than to the latest release. It's maddening. Every week I play the game of having to find the show, click on the right season, and then scroll to the last episode. These are COMPUTERS! And, they previously worked. 'not sure if it's the latest software or firmware, but they're ""dropping the ball"" on the user-interface programming. It's like having a functioning NASA rocket, but it always takes you to Houston rather than the moon.",5
Amazon Customer,Perfect!!!!! But……………,"My fire stick was the perfect choice to going to pure ‘streaming’ method.  User friendly. In search engine, search recognition, full menu of equal user friendly access to a choice of other streaming apps while still providing regular television scheduled shows. While i was super pumped about the sleek, compact design of the remote in comparison to that of the bulky, brick style of the first cell phones to its now counter part, the iphone. BUT……. That thing constantly alludes me. I look for it more than i use it.",3
JB,REMOTE ISSUES,"I Loved this product, ease of use was wonderful. Until my remote stopped working. Most remotesstop working in the area of turn on/off and volume, mine is everything else, but those 2 .I have gone to Roku support several times, and even got someone to call me back last Thursday. After40 minutes of trying things, it was determined that the remote had to be replaced, but due to asystem issue, she could not do it right then. She would call me on Friday and place the order.I have recieved nothing and can't find the location to get a phone callback. I got another remoteout of my pocket (to watch the world series!!) and guess how you program the new remote....With theold one!Will never buy another Roku (this was my 4th one) strickly due to the NO support.",3
Tressa,"The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K balances functionality, price and performance","As 4K HDR devices go, the Fire TV Stick impresses with its balance of functionality, price and performance, which make it a popular purchase when it goes on sale. Even though it's not the most comprehensive device on the market, (or the cheapest, or the most powerful), those used to some of the standard frustrations with Amazon products can get a rock-solid streaming player at a relatively affordable price.ProsExcellent 4K HDR quality, fast navigation, lots of great apps, an upgraded remote that's better than the non-4K remote.ConsAmazon-heavy interface, requires a really inconvenient power adapter.",3
jefe,Its a good value for the money.,My biggest complaint is that the remotes are so cheaply constructed.. it always feels like it is going to fall apart when I use it.. the fire stick is pretty good.. nice image quality and its fast enough.. but it just all really feels cheap.  Maybe that's why it is so cheap.. so if you want to get into the 4k game cheap this a good value.. just know it feels like what you paid for it.,3
S. K. Jones,Turns our Dumb TV into a Smart TV,"We purchased this so we could access TIVO (used by our cable company) and streaming apps on one of our TVs without purchasing/renting an additional cable TV box. It works as it is supposed to. Some of our problems may be learning curve but if the face of the remote were more clear as to what the buttons were for rather than relying on memory, it would be helpful. Also, the on/off button needs to be the largest button. When you're watching in the darkened bedroom, it is hard to see/find the right button.",3
Mack Stewart,Made in China,"Flaw #1 you can only connect one set of headphones or one audio source via bluetooth. However, you can connect your bluetooth headset and bluetooth keyboard simultaneously. A keyboard will come in handy if you have to type in searches or passwords or profile stuff. Oh, and guess what? You won't find anything in the directions about anything related to bluetooth or even on the box. But if you fiddle with the onscreen setting you will run across it.Flaw#2: The directions suckIf your remote doesn't pair with your TV correctly at first just remove your TV and redo the pairing.You can download and install APPS so you can watch movies and TV and you can uninstall them as well. So, if you're not familiar with this, you can download HBO max or Showtime Max and sign up for a monthly subscription without having a cable TV service. There are many free TV apps etc but you will have to deal with ads. ROKU has free TV and movies but you will have to watch a few ads maybe twice during a 45 minute episode of your fav TV show. If you have Amazon prime you may be ad free. I don't know. I don't want to pay for anything or watch ads but I'm dealing with it for now.Flaw#3: The firestick remembers I have headphones paired but when I turn on the device I have to physically go into settings and connect them but sometimes I don't and it will connect them automatically when I turn the headphones on. If I forget to connect my headphones at startup and I go into an APP and start watching a show. I have to go back to the home screen and go into setting and connect my headphones. Then I have to go find the app I was using and go back to my show. The stick doesn't have a recently viewed section that actually works. The problem is there are so many apps that I sometimes forget which app I went into to watch that show. You can however ask Alexa to just play the episode of whatever you were watching if you can remember what you were watching. I feel like this function of continuing watching the show you were watching could be better. You know how everybody likes to binge watch but at some point you have to turn off the TV, right? When you go back the next day there should be a section box that you can click on that shows you what show you were on last and allow you to go right to it. There is a recently viewed section that doesn't really show you what you recently viewed. I call that useless.you have to have good data speeds otherwise you'll never see 4k. I have hotspot on my phone but the data speeds in my area suck most of the time. But I'm paying too much for cell service to buy home internet that isn't much better.Just so you know, this firestick will stay connected to your wifi even when powered off and it will automatically connect when disconnected no matter what. So, when I turn on my phone hotspot the firestick will jump right on and so will my Vizio TV and so will my Laptop. I have to go in my phone and limit my devices so be forwarned.and that's all I know for now",3
Merrill,Blank tv screen,"Overall, we like the new firestick.  Seems like an odd coincidence that when we started using it the tv would randomly go into a blank screen. It doesn't seem to matter what we are watching.  Hitting the back button fixes it.  Never did that with old firestick.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Replacement of a defective firestick remote.,"I purchased this remote on May 12 . 2022. It worked great until Nov.12 ,2022. I have done all I can do from new batteries to multiple reboots from you tube. Nothing worked. I am asking for a new one to be sent to me as per your replacement policy. Thank you for your help.",3
Sabrina,OK,"Debated between 3 and 4 stars due to setup.  After I hooked everything up, the firestick didn't recognize my tv.I tried all the troubleshooting steps, still nothing.  I finally tried a different outlet and in doing so, I also accidentally unplugged the tv.  After everything hooked up again, the firestick recognized the tv and setup proceeded normally.The firestick works well and the alexa feature is nice.  The tv controls are limited, only volume control and the tv icon on the remote only brings up the guide, at least on my 8 year old sony.",3
Brandon Thompson,Fairly easy to use,Forced to buy this by our cable company. Harder for seniors than typical cable remote we are used to. Wish there was a way for our cable app to start when we turn it on. Put the cable app in favorites but still requires some getting used to when we change channels or go back to previous channel.  Otherwise it's great. No longer need Roku box for Netflix or Hulu. Lots of free shows too.,3
janet m rivers,Buying a fire stick was a great decision,Having a fire stick on my TV is awesome. I I always have plenty to watch. I am home bound and all the entertainment has been a blessing.I will gladly recommend this product.,3
Angie,it is not TIVO,"I am not pleased with the record section. Advancing is so slow and cumbersome.  I guess you do not like us skipping advertisements.  The guide feature with it's dull print, makes it difficult to scan schedules shows to plan your nights programs. Also the guide has no indication that tells if a program is new or rerun, without opening the programs site.  Since installing fire stick 2 weeks ago, we have dozens of {please stand by we will return soon} notices every time we view.  We don't know if Starlight is the problem or if it is the system.",4
Cristian G.,Send with full batteries please,"UPDATE!After using Fire TV stick 4K for about 3-4 weeks, I have to restart it at least 2-3 times a day. It loses connection and goes dark. Purchasing the 4K was a huge mistake. I’m reinstalling my original Fire TV.This was purchased as an upgrade for my original Fire TV Stick. Had issues installing but realized the batteries sent with the product are dead, hmm.",5
Kindle Customer,Fire stick Fan,"Let me first say I ordered a fire stick that did not work when I plugged it in. Nothing happened. So I contacted customer service and after being on the phone a good bit completing the troubleshooting steps with them, they finally agreed there was a problem and ordered a replacement. The replacement is working fine, so far, as all the OTHERS have. My experience has been that they work great for a while but they do not last long. I've replaced several of them. I figure they're still worthwhile because of what they offer. I wouldn't even consider a Roku instead. So here's hoping this one has a good long lifespan. Although, with Prime Day coming up I still plan to grab another one, at least, to have as a backup.",3
phyllis henderson,GREAT BUT,This 4k fire stick does a great job for streaming BUT IF ONLY they would increase the RAM to 2MB and The ROM (internal memory) to 16MB.,3
Banjo Billy,Great streaming stick,"Works great, I like the user interface. The only complaint is memory is limited and you can't add an SD card to expand storage... Except by finding a method to use a splitter cable and add a memory stick.  Unfortunately this requires using some fairly complex tweaks, and not everything will transfer to the external storage",3
Curt,FireTv,Good replacement for 4k tv but you have to play with the video adjustments for Disney plus the picture display dark when streaming 4k,3

Donny,Annoying buttons for certain streaming services!,"I bought my new fire stick to replace an earlier version that gave up the ghost. What I got in return was one that has buttons for Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. It is really annoying to accidently press one of the streaming services I don't use! I then need to exit that and return to whatever show I was watching. May be useful to someone who uses all those services, but I don't and they are annoying! I wish I could disable them.",3

Merrill,it works great but..,I love the 4k fire sticks. I got a bunch of them. But there is a little problem. I need to download software that shuts down the apps that run in the background of the fire sticks. It is a pretty big problem if you don't know how to fix it. It makes the ram so slow. But other than that. They work great! Just make sure to clear the ram and force shutdown each app to make the fire sticks run as smooth and you bought them.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Closed captioning is impossible to figure out…,Cannot get CC working. We use the fire stick to access PBS and love the BBC programming but need CC to fully understand the dialogue.,3

Jessica K.,The power adapter is barely adequate,"Once I got this working, then it works great.  The instructions tell you to use the supplied power adapter and cable and I was indeed able to get it working that way.  However, if you want to use a longer HDMI cable, you also have to buy an HDMI coupler female to female.  However, using a longer HDMI cable resulted in the TV complaining of a weak signal and not showing a picture.When I tried using this Fire tv stick with the Amazon Ethernet Adapter for Amazon Fire TV Devices, the stick kept re-booting and would never finish the boot sequence.  All the advice online says to use the supplied Amazon power adapter and cable.  However that advice is wrong.My problem was solved when I replaced the Amazon power adapter with a 1.5 A power adapter (can't read the specs on the Amazon power adapter but suspect that it is lower than that).  Now, the fire tv stick and ethernet adapter work flawlessly.  I can use any length HDMI cable I want.So, if you are having problems, my advice is to replace the Amazon power adapter.  I would have given 5 stars if Amazon had included a better power adapter.  I would have given 6 stars if they had included a HDMI female to female coupler.",3
Amber,Needs One Important Update,"This product works very well and is much faster than previous versions. However, would be so much better if the remote control buttons had lights.

nancy,Does what I needed,"My google chromecast streaming device I was using for ""youtube tv"" failed on the volume control within a month of purchasing it. That meant I had to use 2 controls to watch tv.So I decided to try this unit instead. So far it is working out although there are slight differences that are worth noting.I have not been able to get my firestick to automatically come up on youtube tv. So I have to go through options and pick the app. The chromecast device did allow me to turn on the tv and have it come up on the youtube app. I have not used the voice controls at all and I consider most alexa types of devices to be too invasive. I have no desire to have apps or devices monitoring my activities and constantly making suggestions to ""help"" me. If I didn't ask then don't suggest. Oh well, it is what it is, I just am not comfortable with the constant monitoring of my usage so I don't use it. Probably doesn't make any difference since my usage is most likely monitored whether I want it to or not.Anyway the device is working fine so far.",3

David,Great addition,The ease of setting up the firestick and use is great. It would be great if it had a number keypad to use with applications like DirectTV Stream.,3
Edna Krueger,streaming quality,It is good,4
Manic Reader,Need to improve the remote,"The remotes with the fire stick are complicated. The batteries drain way too fast. A remote battery should last a long time, but the fire stick remote I have I'm lucky it last 2 weeks.",5

steve peeples,Easy - Fast,Had a fire stick from years back that was slow and bogged down.  Upgraded to this model and it works easy and fast.  Nothing to it.  Plug it in and go.,3
Jeff935,Still Issues with Disney +,"This unit is 5G network capable. It stuggled with running those rates according to Ookla. Router was about 20 ft. away. Good signal strengths near the unit as checked on other devices at 5G. Switched down to 2.4G and it was more stable (less intermittent pixelation of images). Disney +  had the same issue as the 1st generation Fire TV Stick with unable to connect errors. Worked with DIsney to get it to work. I had to completely uninstall Disney App, reinstall everything from scratch working with Disney on phone and eventually got to work. I don't know who's fault it is, but I have it working now. No issues with any other apps that I use on a regular basis.",3
CC,remote should lay flat and be bigger,"it,s great. could have more instructions.  just too darn small for old hands.  should have caption ability.5 stars if i was  younger.",3

RealTime,How to properly access all content .,Am not able to access all the content that is supposed to be loaded on the stick - VERY disappointed .,3
Marizol Lantigua,Hidden secrets,"Device works fine for reception, clarity and voice recognition. I canceled my Spectrum cable (went over to Sling for which I have other comments if it comes up for review) and wanted ESPN for the Fire TV. It's in the app store and it let me download. But I was not able to activate it because I did not have Spectrum access. Same catch 22 applies to other apps as well. Am keeping the device as it allows me to stream 4k movies in Prime which I could not otherwise do.",3
Annoymous ,Nice way to get into the world of Fire TV,"Like the title says, nice way to get into the firestick market.Having also buying Google's Chromecast and TiVo's Streaming thingy (NOT the recording thingy), this fire TV is much much better. Even better than the built-in Roku that came with my TV.Love it!!!!",3
Amazon Customer,Turns your normal TV into a smart TV,"Stream 4k YouTube videos quickly, has games, Amazon prime, and more!  Cheap answer to ""cutting the cord!""",3
Amazon Customer,Works,Works well,4

Mark R. Wietstock,Should come loaded,"Didn’t like that I had to find the additional apps, which some didn’t work,like the sports app",3
Greaty,A 5-star device now ships with a 3-star remote with useless buttons,"We have several of the earlier model of this product, and I must say it is quite good. But I just had one of them die on me, never to get past the boot logo, so I was hoping to be able to purchase this earlier model again. But this one is the only model now available, and it suffers from Roku syndrome, meaning it has useless buttons on its remote that are non-programmable shortcuts to app subscriptions that we neither have nor want. Well, we do have Prime, but the other stuff is useless, especially since we have no trouble downloading any app that we do want. I had dared to hope that Roku had learned their lesson early on with their useless remote button crap when they had the Rdio button and Rdio went the way of the dinosaur. But no, they keep right on doing it to this day, and now it seems everyone including Amazon has jumped on the bandwagon without even thinking about end users possibly not having or wanting subscriptions or companies discontinuing apps, which happens all the time. Here's a thought. You'll get a star back if you give us back the older remote that just had volume and power buttons on it, or maybe add some channel up/down buttons and an input switcher to take the place of the useless non-programmable subscription buttons. Of course simply allowing end users to program four of their favorite apps to these shortcut buttons would certainly make them useful as well, and would be a very good selling point for these newer devices. Meanwhile, although the 4K Fire Stick is a really good device, I will look elsewhere to replace the 2018/2019 model I had that died, and we will just keep right on using the rest of these older sticks until they also die or stop supporting the apps and subscriptions we do have, which incidentally don't have non-programmable buttons for them on the new remotes.",3

Amazon Customer,It works.  A while lot of ads on screen though,"Yikes!  It works but lord it is annoying. I thought it would be like other little devices where you see your subscriptions and you pick one and off you go.  No, Amazon's interface looks like the side of a building in building in Times Square.  There is ad junk everywhere for things you are not subscribed to and have no interest in.",3

L. Davis,4k vs LITE,"Have several LITES, but they don’t work with volume and turning on-off TV, so got this one for non-smart TV in garage.

Henry P. Pierce,Works as should but came with old software...,"This is a nice firestick 4K, I bought 2 of them. The only issue I have is the OS Version. They both came with OS 6, While my Plain Fire stick (3rd gen) came with OS 7.On OS 7 you can see a extended drive if you add one via an OTG cable, on the 4K firesticks you cannot see the ext. memory, unless you use a 3rd party app like XPlorer.",3
LdotM,Es rapido,Muy buen producto,3
Sondra Steger,It works,Easy to set up.,3
T McCann,Very Good Fire Stick,"I got this cause my 3rd generation fire stick was giving me all kinds of problems,from buffering issues to the voice not paring with the actors voices.It was very easy to set up,one of the features I liked was the paring of my Blue Tooth Sound Bar,it gave me a list after my TV sound couldn't find the sound.I don not have a 4k TV but the picture on my Samsung Smart TV is great,I see some improvement of the picture.The only problem I have intermittently (Why I gave it 4 stars)is sometimes I have to go back because again the voices are not in tune with the people speaking.But after I re-start the movie news program,etc.Everything mates.The remote is 100 times better than the last remote (2nd generation) I can control the sound bar from my chair,mute it,go to Prime all in one remote.However I have another Samsung TV that I use as a monitor for my computer and sometimes it shuts or turns on the TV.I definitely recommend this Fire Stick.",3
NP,Everything is awesome till today,"So, I had 2 previous models before and one just broke and the other one’s remote also broke from itself, so I told myself to try a better model and purchased this one on Nov 7th, 21.Well, it is not even a year! Today started to acting up just like being controlled by someone else remotely. Scared the hell out of me. Did every troubleshooting I know, factory reset and still acting up. It is moving between apps from itself, went to Hulu to register a new acct, kicked me out of Netflix on TV and tried to log me into it on the stick. Factory reset didn’t help.It is either preloaded with a virus or a glitch in it's system that can’t be fixed.Now. Back to my old one using the new remote and hoping it will last a little longer.Advise: if you are thinking to buy, don’t be fool like me, buy a protection plan as well.Update: contacted costumer service and they will replace it with a new one and will send the old one I have back to them.Upgraded the stars to 4",3
john f,Easy To Figure Out,Mostly easy to set up...once I plugged it in the correct HDMI port. I would have liked back lit buttons so I could see them in the dark when I'm watching at night. Make sure you have your laptop handy. It's much easier to sign on to the various apps on a laptop than a phone. I like the Alexa feature...sure beats scrolling through hundreds of shows to find one.,3

Vivo en El Salvador y solo hay 2 aspectos que me gustaría que merjoraran:1. Que los perfiles guarden la configuarción para cada streaming, pues cuando cambia el usuario que está viendo, todos los perfiles de los streaming, de la última persona que lo utilzó, quedan guardados.2.

Mark R. Wietstock,"Good, but miss some cable features","The picture and the sound are excellent, but I do miss not being able to punch in a channel number as we did with our cable. Sometimes the Stream takes a while due to internet issues, and it is also not quite as convenient as the cable in terms of easily recording programs.",3
Amazon Customer,I am enjoying Fire Stick and especially the 4K aspect really clear love it,I disliked the frequent buffering but I like the variety of shows and movies and you can ask Alexa anything she will get that program for you.  Why I bought The Fire Sick I like watching a variety of movies and shows you can’t always find on cable so that’s why.,3
salah,Not happy,Cannot get remote to work correctly. It won't use voice recognition and the remote will not turn the TV on,3

Nancy Drew,4k Firestck,I enjoy using my 4K Firestick. I really thought my family & I would have be going through cable withdrawal. Using the 4K Firestick took sometimes getting adjusted. Using the 4K Firestick made the adjustment subtle and smooth transition. My husband enjoys speaking the channels into the remote. We don't anything that uses Alexa beside the remote.,5

Jan Villa,Nice But Could Be Better,"I find the streaming function to be excellent, but the interface is clumsy, confusing, and unfriendly.

Don Niosi,Doesn’t work well with Samsung smart tv,I’ve found that the fire stick doesn’t work well with the Samsung smart tv. It’s the tv itself because it works fine on my Visio tv.  I don’t have Alexa so I can’t comment on how it works.,3

When it works it is great, I just hate having to do the reset almost everytime I turn the TV back on.",3

SW CORNER,Easy,"Easy to integrate.  I am so unhappy but the price dropped $10 the day after I received it.  I should have waited, waited, waited.  It was on Deal for the Day so I believed that would be the best price.  I was wrong. Otherwise I would have given it a total of 5 stars.",5

Sheila Butler,Control remoto se daña muy rápido,"El control remoto de FireTV Stick se daña muy rápido, y su reemplazo es muy caro, mejor comprar uno nuevo.",3
Merrill,Love the Firestick but could use some tweaks...,"This is our second style of Firestick and we bought one for each room. I was really excited with the quick click buttons on the bottom of the remote, we do not use Hulu so that button is never used. We have had the new 4K stick since it came out and I am a little disappointed. We run out of storage, all the time. I hoped this new stick would have a LOT more storage but it didn't. I have no idea where all the storage goes! The buttons are a year or so old and are almost rubbed off. The last remote is in the same condition and I have had it over 5 years.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Works well across streaming platforms,Works great but inability to delete some apps takes up a lot of memory space,3

Mrs. C,Remote Quality is Terrible,"I've had a fire stick for a while (pre-volume buttons on the remote) and I've been upgrading my house to the newer fire sticks. Not sure how these new remotes that come with the newer fire sticks are passing QC. The battery case doesn't fit the remote and is loose. I thought my first fire stick remote was just a fluke, but then I bought two more for my other TV's and all of them have the same issue with the remotes. The old fire sticks (pre-volume buttons) had a snug battery cover, but buying a silcone sleeve shouldn't have to be the solution for an out of the box remote.",3
Phileous P. Schmoo,Easy hookup and works well,Works well easier than my old fire stick I would recommend it,3
Me,Extremely simple to install and setup.,I truly appreciate the simplicity of this device and all of the features available with it.,3
Margaret York,"Not the best experience for me, but i wanted the upgrade.","I upgraded to this from the 2nd Gen firestick. It works fine and im happy with it, especially the shortcut buttons on the remote to apps like Netflix, prime video, hulu ect. I was able to remap them to my liking. I am very disappointed with the feel and quality of the new remote compared to the 2nd gen one. It feels like cheap plastic and some of the buttons don't feel as durable. I noticed a common complaint that these firesticks are not 8GB as advertised, but about 5GB instead. Overall, i'm happy with it's performance, although from time to time I do experience ""bugs"" where ill hit the volume down button once and it'll go down twice (not a setting issue). When I press the Netflix button, it goes to the app, but switches my TV to the other HDMI channel which is annoying but I bypassed this issue by plugging the firestick into that channel.The unit was shipped in a bubble mailer so maybe thats the cause for my issues, but nothing inside the box looked damaged, and was packed nicely. I had amazon put my account on it ahead of time so it didnt take long to set up. Also, on my 2nd gen firestick, it used to be that when id have my bluetooth headphones connected, I could toggle the volume on them with the remote. On this 3rd gen unit, It doesn't allow me to adjust the volume at all, aside from the tv volume which is inconvenient and annoying.I've been using this unit for about 2 months and it still works fine, batteries are still good. Will update further should anything new develop with this unit.",3

Customer 786,Convenient But has some issues,"I love the convenience of having a remote rather than an app on my phone for chromecast, however there are several issues that I didn't have with chromecast. Volume. Sometimes I have to turn the volume wayyyy up and it's still difficult to hear. Connection issues. There are times it takes a long time to connect, despite using the extender. And the most frequent and most annoying issue is lip-sync error. Daily. I've tried shutting it off and try to watch again - it still is off. Extremely frustrating and annoying.",3
Dale Wood,Todo bien pero...,"El control funcionaba perfectamente, hasta que pasaron 3 meses de uso, comenzó a descargar las baterías muy rápido, un par me duraban solo un día, tuve que comprar otro control",3
Iva,How long will it last?,"The fire TV I purchased replaced one that didn't make it for 2 years before failing.  This one seems to work fine but only time will tell if it will continue.  As a precaution, I am unplugging it from the power source when not in use as having it constantly ""on"" may have shortened the life of the last one.

Texasgal,For an upgrade.. it's worth it.,Not really much to say other than it's a solid device. I am though a bit concerned on the storage space side of things but other than that the Wi-Fi would always need improving like most things but nothing a little clearing the cache and giving it some rest from time to time won't help. Because it's very helpful actually xD.,3

Ashwin,For those having Remote pairing issues...Overall good product,"Like many reviews here... I had significant issues with getting the remote to pair.  It seems to be an issue with the software version on the device being mis-matched with the software on the remote with the Alexa button.I was able to work around this by pairing an existing remote I had for the Firestick with the simple Voice button on top(that also had volume control) - that remote worked almost instantly after pressing the home button for 10 seconds and I was able to complete the setup.  I was still unable to add the new remote no matter what I did (would not show up as discoverable)I then had to do a software update on the Fire stick; which then made the NEW remote discoverable but it ALSO required an update before it would finish the setup.  Once both the firestick and the new remote were updated, it all finally worked as expected.I'm unaware of a solution if you do not have an older remote to do the initial setup of the fire stick.Otherwise the performance of the device is great.  No complaints on features/functionality.",3

Mark R. Wietstock,So far it's working well,"After I connected it to my correct amazon account, all is good now.  Got my YouTube TV on there, my YouTube acct too, and the sorting through the channels are better than Google Fiber.  Set up easy but it's awkward with the wiring - can't explain it but the connection goes up (instead of down) so the wire is facing north (to ceiling) and puts pressure on that USB/whatever connection to the TV - so I had to tape it to the back of the TV to alleviate the pressure of the wire (hope that makes sense?).  But so far streaming looks good and controls are simple yet good.",5

Vincent Sasso,I Like It But…,"It’d be great if Amazon would let you remove some of the default apps like Photos, News, Amazon Music, Amazon Kids, Amazon Live Shopping, etc. I don’t have kids so don’t need that but they also take up so much space where I can only download 4 other apps before I get a message that says “Not Enough Storage” to update another app I don’t need but keeps trying to update. Some of the downloaded apps are even on the remote’s shortcuts.I also wish the shortcut buttons at the bottom could be customizable since I only use two of those streaming services. I could add another app as a shortcut. I sometimes accidentally bump a buttons which interrupts what I’m watching so it’d be cool if the buttons were smaller.Overall, nothing really different than my fire stick before this one but Amazon could at least give more storage space and let users be able to uninstall some of those default apps.",3
Robert Verminski,Easy setup,This was so easy to setup and use. The voice recognition is good and makes using the Fire TV Stick even easier to use.,3
Aandrews,Fire stick fun,I have enjoyed my fire stick. Didn't have any problems setting it up and have enjoyed many programs that is on it.,3
James D. Ellicott,Good not great,"Setup was not seamless, it took several tries and some experimentation.  Use is a bit cumbersome, and it does not support a number of apps I believed that it would, which makes it less useful than I had hoped.  Alexa integration is nice, and useful  So overall a good product but did not quite accomplish what I had hoped it would.",3
Vincent DeCaro,Hizo mi TV inteligente,"Funcionaba todo bien, ahora el control dejó de funcionar, hemos seguido los pasos para ligarlo nuevamente al Fire TV pero sigue sin funcionar",3
Amazon Customer,Fire stick streaming not the fastest but good,"Fire stick runs somewhat smoothly but when it does have problems, it HAS problems. I usually have to turn it off completely and come back to it later. Other than that Alexa works good for the most part, and the voice recognition is pretty accurate. Overall I like it. Roku is more user friendly but the fire stick is not hard to use",3
Paul Baker,Once it is up and running it is great,"This model seems to have some setup issues, and based on my support searches, im not the only one who encountered this.  Initial setup was a nightmare.  Even with 500Mbps Internet, the out of box update would hang @ about 85%.  I waited 3 hours for it to update before I decided to pull the plug.  A restart got me to the same place.  After 2 factory resets, the stick finally updated.  Once that was done, it was smooth sailing.  I'm a fairly technical person, so i cannot imagine what someone with only basic tech knowhow would react to this.  I talked to 3 people who returned theirs as defective after encountering this problem.  Amazon support was not very helpful  They wanted me to change the HDMI port.  I tried this on multiple TVs and monitors before and after the first factory reset and the result was the same unresponsive hang.  Ive had the stick for about a month now and it is working perfectly.  But that initial setup was enough to make me want to go back to my google tv",3
Edward Polovitch,Does the job,Purchased a new fire stick since the old one I had no longer worked with the remote. Usual streaming capabilities. I like that the remote has buttons for some streaming platforms. It is still glitchy at times much like the last one. Will freeze and disconnect from the wireless network. I restart it and it seems to help.,3
Amazon Customer,Fire stick,No complaints at all easy to use did exactly what it was supposed to,3
Merrill,Love the Firestick!,"I use this for streaming. I have Amazon Prime, so it works well.",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Need to add Sankey tv compatibility,Is a good product but need to work on Sankey tv compatibility,3
Maureen,Will return,The remote is wobbly and feels like it will fall apart. The connection seems to break a lot. Will return for a replacement because I have had four in the past that seemed fine for a year or two. Not the best product for longevity.,4
Jwm,Best streaming stick,Little less memory and power than max version but still recommend. Price was great as well.,5
Marisol Reyes,Very good,Had fire sticks for years and they keep getting better,3
steinhausmin,Upgrade from Chromecast,I just received this firestick a few hours ago and I'm really happy with it. It's much more convenient to have a remote than just using the phone to control what you want to watch. Plus Alexa works flawlessly so far.,3
NYMAN,Nice upgrade,"Upgraded from an older firetv that couldn’t keep up any longer. It’s 32-bit rather than 64-bit which is annoying in todays age, but it works just fine. I did not like the loss of a hardwired Ethernet port so I had to buy that separately.Overall, it is fast and smooth. I love the remote being able to control my separate receiver/sound system and TV!",3
Mr. Q,good product,"It is a good product but I like my Roku better.  Roku is easier to find movies, etc and view menu.  Fire stick does have voice and volume on remote but I really don't need that",3
Monique,Good buy for the money,The one time buy instead of fees,3
Shoshose,Great product. But...,"It's a great product all in all. And I would definitely buy it again.But, I wish it had the option of downloading all apps on the google play store. I have many apps I wish I could have downloaded that are not available to download.",3
dew,Great,We are still learning the tricks.,3
Veronica K.,If you have any other Amazon products then you need this,"Look I get it, we sacrifice Amazon listening to our personal conversations for privacy but dang is it not cool to say ""Alexa turn on Hulu"" and it works. If you have any of the Dots/shows and this hooked up to that TV, you don't really need a remote. It's like you're living in the future or at least a 1960's version of a dystopian future where corporations can listen to your every word.",3
Merrill,Love it,Streaming quality is amazing,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Easy to use,Was easy to set up and works great,3
Eddie Jones,Freezes or won’t start,"The picture quality and features are very good. The only issue I gave with it is every day or so it will not load when I turn on the TV. I have to unplug the power, remove it from the hdmi input on the tv. Wait a minute or do and reconnect everything. Then it will work for a couple days then I have to repeat the process. I have reset it to factory once and it worked for about a week then started not loading again.",3
vamsi manoj,Very easy to install as I am on Amazon Prime!,"Current Bedroom TV was not accepting new Apps,",4
MF,It works,I subscribed to a new streaming service and needed 4 of these units so I could use the service on 4 TV's in the home.  The set up is straight forward and they work well.,5
Robert Reef,Works really well except for the inability to enlarge videos from Movie Apps to Full Screen.,"I like the price for the product compared to a ROKU device.  As mentioned earlier, I didn't like the fact that I couldn't enlarge to Full Screen on movie Apps.",3
Sam,The quality,It has made watching t v more enjoyable,3
JJ,Works,Works great,3
Sam Tilleman,Nice upgrade,Kind of small,3
Kristi&Dusty,A heck of a lot better than my old one,Works great,3
K. Moore,Works great! As expected,"Fire sticks work great for accessing most streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney plus, Prime Video, Peacock, etc. However, I wish they would add The Daily Wire app to the App Store. It's a bummer not every app is available through fire stick.",3
Don Peabody,Very impressed,Good product,3
Merrill,I’ll surely have to get used to it.,"I’m not sure if we can get our local news with it, I just never get to use the remote, my husband is usually monitoring it, even if I have to tell him what to do next. Alexa does mostly what he says but it’s seldom that he uses it. The pictures are really good quality. Better than we’ve had I. The past. Thanks!",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Very Good,It took a while to set it up. The program is the controller. I had to do it about 10 times to set it up. The picture and the sound were very good. I use it to save from renting a cable box for $8.50 a month but it's very hard to get to the channels on cable without turning them one by one.,3
mratan,The Hulu funcion does not work with all ISPs.,"Hulu on this device will not work with all ISPs.  I have T-Mobile Internet At Home and Hulu won't work because its geolocation service thinks that I am not at home.  My ISP uses IP addresses registered from all over the country, and Hulu refuses to allow me to watch my PAID service on my own device.  All devices that I try to access Hulu from are on the same IP address.  My computer plays Hulu just fine, but it refuses to allow my Fire TV stick, or my Hulu enabled TV to use the service.",3

steve heneise,Easy to install and use,Title says it all,4
Phil,Is your old fire stick a little slow?  Technology has changed.,"We have enjoyed streaming with Amazon’s Fire Stick for at least five years, but technology has changed and with it your WiFi signal.  I noticed our existing Fire Sticks were acting a little less responsive so I decided to order the new 4K model.  What a difference!  Love the new options integrated into the remote too.",5
Doris Newton,Great Buy,The Fire TV Stick is a great but for me instead of regular Cable service. My IP (AT&T) is a bit slow so I do get glitches but I see no fault with the stick. Set-up was really easy (once I paid attention to the instructions). Good product. Now if only the cable networks would stop gouging us!,3
Doug,Where's the storage??,Upgraded firesticks. It's an improvement everywhere but storage for apps. Even just doubling the current storage would be SUPER beneficial.,3
Edward A. Hamilton,Performance,Yes,3
Giancarlo,"Never had a fire stick, still playing with it.","I purchased this a while ago, and I'm still trying to figure it out, It's fun if you're retired and have time on your hands. I'm all over this fire stick thing, movies to the max, lots of Free Be's too. Think I'll look for documentaries next? Would enjoy some good old history channels, we'll see. Big Foot, have to find some big foots in here? Until then, I'll be a lookin.",3
Linda Blount,Great product!,"Easy to use, buttons in the correct order, and a small controller that fits in your hand correctly.",3
Jessie Ong,Nice addition to our Vizio Smart TV 2017 model D32,"We like this Firestick, and the operation of it. My only complaint is lack of instructions. Apparently it is assumed you have a newer TV, but nothing for setting this up on older smart tv's such as we have, which is a 2017 Vizion model D32 with HDMI port.Took me about half hour to finally figure out how to get the Firestick and our HDMI to find each other. I finally realized with our TV, you have to set your input...in this case input was HDMI...but for some reason it synced up with HDMI2 connection. I didn't understand it, but it is working well, after I figured out why I was seeing nothing about Firestick.In any case, after it did a software update, and finally booted up, worked well. Takes some time to find your way around and navigate, but this is a very clever nice addition to any Smart TV, especially older ones. I unplug the Firestick every night before we stop watching TV, you don't have too, but we do.A lot to watch that is included with Prime, as well as a lot through IMDBTv that has ads, but still a good selection of shows. The ads on IMDBTv are not too intrusive or long, it is just nice to be able to catch some shows we like and older shows.If you have a newer smart TV, I am sure it is easier to setup, but do not expect to be presented with many instructions, what you get is ok, but no addressing older TV's or any models in particular. You are on your own with that, but the instructions themselves are ok...just not any help for connecting to various TV's.Nice unit, worth the 29.99 we paid for it, and we love Prime too!",3
Merrill,Battery cover loose,"The battery cover is comes of easy. When holding it, the cover comes of easily",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Finally cut the cable and saved $$$,"still getting used to this device.  There is a bit of a learning curve as using it is not immediately intuitive.  Every so often, I get lost in the work flow of the device between its home mode (Firestick) and what is has and my YouTubeTV streaming app, with all the latter's content and 85+ channel live TV lineup.  I can't compare it to ChromeCast or other devices, but I don't think you will be dissatisfied with it once you become accustomed to it.  If you have a family member who needs the ultimate simplify  of a very intuitive interface (i.e. computer challenged) , this device (and perhaps some others) may be a bit much for them.  But to be fair, you may be able to set up a profile for them specifically that makes navigation much more simple by limiting content to what they only want.  BY THE WAY, cutting the ""cable cord"" is also cutting my cable bill by 50%.  Lastly, Firestick significantly improved picture quality ...even beyond that of fiber based services.  I had FIOS.",3
C. Earnshaw,New is Better vs Refurbished,Purchased a refurbished version which didn't last long and definitely didn't feel of the same quality as a new remote. The wheel dial seems to fail and get loose after some use. A solid 4 if you get the new version. I would stay away from a refurb,3
Armando Chairez,Value for money product,It works well for me it's just that the alex doesn't work.,3
ms,Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device,Only gave 4 stars because a few different times it wouldn't work for some reason. Luckily someone else had the same issue & made a video on how to fix it.,3
Daniel Dalhouse,Ease of use,Need for Firestick buttons to light up at night.,3
Christine N Schenck,Capable Streamer. Grab one when deeply discounted,"I had an older 4K firestick that appears identical to this one except for the remote. But this one is MUCH faster in terms of on screen use.  Very snappy performance. Picture quality is very good too once you turn OFF the always on HDR, which will turn the picture to mud. It's on by default for some reason. Also make sure 4K is turned on (or auto) if you have a 4K set... Which presumably you do since there is no reason to buy this Fire Stick if you don't. Is it worth $50?  No, but for half that price, heck yeah.  And with a new 4K stick coming soon, discounts like that are  probably going to be common...so cash in when you can.This probably checks every box you have. 4K. Dolby Vision. all forms of HDR, a voice remote with buttons  that controls all essential TV functions (volume, channel, mute) with dedicated Netflix, Amazon, Disney+ and Hulu buttons...So if you have an older stick, and a newer 4K Dolby Vision set,  going to this stick is a no brainer.The only downside is you have to download all your streaming service apps again,  digging out the names and passwords of each one.  A major pain.  Amazon keeps track of everything else, including your  wi-fi network, so not sure why it cant do this too.  But it does not for some reason, despite a step in the setup process that sort of implies it does.  If so,  that process did not work for me.I know the new version of this stick is upgraded, supports WIFI 6 (which I have) and Atmos (which I don't)  But can't see its worth twice the price of this one.",4
Renee Guthrie,Much better picture then cable service.,Not easy to install. Have a pro help you. Once in it will take a while to understand the operation. It is worth the training for the quality of the picture.,5

D. Waller,It works.,"I don't have much truck with Alexa yet - call me a Luddite.  But the thing works, and I've found a few freebies to watch.  We ditched cable TV and bought this to access Prime Video and Pluto (ad-supported TV, just like the old days!) and whatever else.  So far have not missed cable at all.  There are more free movies and YOutubes and stuff than I could watch in a lifetime.  I think we bought a $5 sub to KERA the public channel here - wife likes that.  BTW I wrapped much of the remote with hockey stick tape - got a free roll from the Internet - to give a better grip on that slippery banana peel of a remote.  It's so slipper that it will squirt halfway across the room if there isn't some friction material added to it.",3
George,Great addition to our spare bedroom,We has heard the Firestick was a useful product but we never expected it to work as well as it does.  The firestick allows our spare bedroom to watch TV just like we can in the living room.  We will be buying another for our den.,3
Merrill,Each generation gets better.,"Have to replace our FireTV sticks every couple of years because Amazon builds in  obsolescence, so wasn't pleased about this, but knew we knew we had to upgrade :-/  (therefore, 4 not 5) The tv is the farthest awat from out wireless router, and the previous stick sometimes had trouble connecting or maintaining a connection. This one has no connectivity issues.",3

Quit them and went with the Fire TV Stick 4K and it worked extremely well, streaming service id great through the use of the Fire Stick.

Maria L,Remote Pairing Issues,"Unfortunately, the remote pairing for setup issues are real. I was able to work around it with an old FireStick remote. The FireStick requires a software upgrade to be able to pair with the new remotes. I was able to setup the FireStick with the old remote, update software, and then pair the new Alexa voice remote.",3
J Smith,Good stick,"I like the firestick since it is easy to use, it literally walks you through setup and in about 15-20 minutes you are up and going.  The picture quality is great and the streaming is good as long as you have a good network.One drawback I do not like is the layout.  The advertising on home page can be annoying.  It does keep what you are in the middle of watching in one of the top rows.  I do not like the push for prime shows, it could be layed out better with filters for free shows vs prime, paramount, tubi, free, and so on.On the newer models you have buttons on the bottom for netflix, disney and whatever.  I don't use them so I consider them a waste of remote space.I would like to see the remote upgraded to glow buttons, I have seen these on other remotes, if you move the remote the buttons will have a soft light to them so you can see what you are pressing.Walk tall and carry a big stick!",4
BlueKnightX,Big big improvement from the OG Fire stick but high pitchy Alexa voice,The streaming quality is a lot faster.Not pixelated or laggy in any way.Actually stays connected to wifi.The Alexa when it responds back is high pitched which cause the speakers of my tv to crackled. And I can’t find a setting that just lowers the Alexa voice.Other then that it’s great!,5
JWFlournoy,Movie's color,The colors on the movie or just great,3
Merrill,Good picture but note it does not control TV as indicated,"As I was not satisfied with the streaming apps that came on our Sony 4K smart TV and particularly HATED the Sony remote, I thought that this Fire TV stick would be better.  Frankly, the Fire stick does provide a brighter and sharper picture on our smart TV but the web description states that it ""controls the TV"" so I thought that it would allow me to dump my Sony remote.  However, the 4K Fire stick ONLY controls the volume and power on the TV and has no controls for the TV ""Input"", TV ""Settings"" or any other TV control.  Thus we have to use both the Fire remote and the TV remote (and....the sound bar remote)!  So I returned it.Overall, the Fire streaming sticks work well and we have another (older model) one on our bedroom TV.  Amazon needs to clarify the TV functions that the Fire stick actually does control.",3

I can usually get it operating again by turning everything off then restarting.  Sometimes a restart doesn't work the first time.After I stopped the tv cable service with Comcast, I was surprised to receive a free streaming box which does everything the Firestick does.

I ended up using the fire stick on my Hisense tv in the bedroom & so far no issues with the device actually working. And the stream quality is 4 stars bc occasionally the show/program is fuzzy or there are blips while streaming. Overall I’m happy bc I can watch AMC+ on a wider screen instead of my laptop or iPhone.

PEGGY HUTTON,Must have if cutting out your cable tv.,Got the 4k version. Works great and can add channels for what i really want to watch versus paying for cable tv which had nothing on it i cared to watch.

Rupert,Dissapointed,"I recently purchased this item with the expectation that with a trade-in of an old device I would receive a 20% discount which would be applied during checkout.  That did not happen Amazon! I did not receive a 20% discount during checkout! I did receive a whopping $3 bucks for my old firestick + charger + USB cable + voice remote.  I deregistered the old firestick then the morning of the next day I dropped off my old firestick at the location suggested thinking maybe, just maybe I'll receive the 20% discount once they have the old device. I received a confirmation email from Amazon saying my trade-in has been received and processed. But Nope! Still No 20% Discount!  I then called so called customer support after acquiring the # via google.  They were of no help.  They actually suggested I purchase another one so I put one in my cart and started the purchase process and the 20% discount was applied to that one.  Nowhere did I see where you had to turn in the trade-in device first then receive confirmation for it before purchasing the new firestick!  Very disappointed with this Amazon trick",3

Peggy,Ease of use,The fire Stik performed as expected but it does take some getting used to.  This is especially true when using You Tube TV. It requires multiple steps to find what you want. If you have a TV that's less than 55 inches it is sometimes hard to see the information that's on the screen.,5

tony trap,Great,Faster thats it nothing extra,3

Rem Lou,Nice addition to Streaming Tools,Liked the easy to install and apps that are available with the Fire Stick,3
Merrill,Best smartTV stick but needs memory card slot.,"It's really worth your money in terms of price, function and entertainment value above most competition. Unfortunately, as you wander into deeper real of enjoyment you'll be prompted of low storage and deleting other apps. Sadly it will be a brickwall for the more advanced users. I installed Real Racing 3 and it was functional, looks good but only able to finish the training/tutorial race. No more space left to download 1GB of game date to play the real game. There's plenty of juice in this stick to render the game fairly playable. Asphalt 8 racing game runs fine and smooth which is impressive. I hope there's a way to increase storage space. Cheers!",3
Mark R. Wietstock,Not open yet,Came right away greatly packaged but I have not opened it yet I was saving it for when I moved I also bought the cube recently I haven’t opened that either I hope I don’t have to worry about anything or because I’m not opening my stuff until I move that my wine she will run out I hope not because like I stated nothings open yet and hasn’t been hooked up yet as I’m sure you can tell,3

Herman,"Easy, lightweight, updated remote","I had to buy a new firestick after the first one died.  I was give a discount, but the price could have been cheaper.",3
mary u.,Love the new features and volume on remote,I have the original stick which is very slow to work with pulling up what you need. Upgraded to this stick and love the ease of the remote. Quality of pic is good. Remote is very response and added plus to have volume control finally. I gave it four stars since I really wish Amazon would redesign the stick itself. It is annoying to fit it in properly to the tv ports or if my tv is flat on the wall. The additional connector just makes it stick out from the side and just gets in the way and looks unprofessional. This needs a different design.,3
Merrill,Works very well,Works very well now though it did'nt at first but the tech was very helpful and got it to work fine after awhile. A bit difficult to use.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,These work great as long as you have a good wi-fi signal,I have four of these and use them rather than pay the extra for four cable boxes. They work fine as long as your wi-fi signal is good...,3
Wildthing33,Good,I love it. Makes watching TV easy. Have a lot of options to choose from. The remote though seems like it could or will fall apart anytime soon.,3
Magdalena,Easy to set up,Easy to set up if you already have an account. Just transfer from it.,3
A.K.,"Good device, but the remote could be more intuitive","I have had four of these Fire Sticks prior to this one. Each gets incrementally better. I am not a fan of the remote control layout. For one thing, it is not lighted, so it requires a fair amount of light to see the buttons, which are not especially logical. The ring control is a poor design and having the options in one of nine unmarked buttons is irritating. The listing of other streaming services (besides Prime Video) suggests a payoff. Really, Disney+? Why not Apple+? The home page is a mini-mental status test. It could be better. I actually got yet another Fire Stick because neither Xfinity nor my Sony smart TV has the Apple TV+ app, so I am forced to go through yet another device that I, personally, don't need for other streaming. Kind of irritating.",3
D. Porter,Very easy installation and works well. No problems.,Had a firestick for a couple of years and it eventually froze up . So I bought a newer firestick  a d works great.,3
Ric-Hard,Beautiful picture,I had to get used to the new look of the home screen. But the picture quality on a TV thats not 4k is still very bold in color and crisp!,3

I still gave it 4 stars because this is my 3rd Fire Stick but the 1st with this issue.",3
Leslie Curtin,Worked as expected,All is well,3
Merrill,Muy bien,Muy bien,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Over rated,I was not told ahead of time that it would not work in UHD on my Samsung 4000HD because of it not having a 2.2 HDMI port. It doesn't look good in 1080D.,3
Mae McKay,It work as expected,"Ho,  Once I followed the instructions, it was easy to set up and use.  Currently have everything set up for easy access. NetFlix, Amazon Prime, Disney, Pluto, FX, ESPN+, Curiosity Stream...  So far, everything is working as expected. Able to access everything with 0 issues.",3
PJ,The ease of use,I like mostly everything about the product. What I didn't like is the fact you can't control the volume in the car with the remote. I use my fire stick for the car only.,3
jpd.john,Little slow in navigating but otherwise good,"After a couple weeks I had to return mine. It had issues with powering up, seem to be a issues with adaptor and cable? My biggest issue was the constant updates that take a long time. Also apps like Discovery Plus takes a long time to load up and even longer to start playing selected content. It was so bad I thought at times it was not going to start because all I saw was the spinning circle. The interface seems more dedicated to Amazon content then anything else. I felt like it was hard to navigate to other providers. I think it does work better for those who mostly use Amazon content services.",3

Merrill,It was easy to set up,Glad to have chosen the Amazon fire stick,3
Mark R. Wietstock,"Great for What It Does, But BEWARE INTERNET OVERAGES","As much as anyone else, I can say that I like this streaming device. It playbacks in great quality and it has everything you need to stream your favorite apps. Where the problem lies is with the amount of internet it uses. This is something Amazon won't tell you, but any of their streaming sticks throttle your wifi into itself. In just six hours total of using the stick, my family used up around 60% of our allowed data and we pay for 1.5TB of data. Not only that, but whenever it's on, it runs down the speed of every other device in the house. As of now, we've disabled the 4K quality and put it down to the weakest option. I haven't noticed a change in quality, but the internet usage has dropped tremendously. It still throttles quite a bit, but only around 35% a month.",3
Lori,Love it!,I like everything about it! Especially when the other cable goes out because of a storm or something and my fire stick is still working.,3
Consumer Person,Not bad,"Not bad only useful if you don’t have a smart TV, but overall not bad.",3
jane wantuck,Works great when your internet is working,It works great when your internet is working.,3
Barry Trunk,Works well with Recast,"Had an early version of Fire Stick which was obviously having issues with streaming. Decided to replace it with this version. This device works much better, faster & more reliable in all respects.We have also been having issues with doing things like deleting & changing recording programing on our Fire TV Recast this version of the Fire Stick has none of those issues. in the short term this probably saved the Recast from being put on the shelf, but also shows that Amazon needs to update both its Fire TV app on iOS and its older but still supported devices like the Fire TV Cube. At the end of the day Amazon doesn't seem to be making supporting the Fire TV ecosystem a priority.",3
Pam Barr,Practical,Very easy to set up. Practical addition to home viewing.,3
Linda,Great upgrade,"Really like was able to upgrade to the remote that does the volume controls vs. having two  remotes, the addition with the quick buttons is nice (would be even better if you could pick the four vs. preloaded)",3
Johnny Heil,Easy to learn and use.,Nothing so far.,3
Qu33n,It works,CC was hard to set,3
Lee Bivens,Trade in of non working device,Had the same product that stopped working just past the warranty period. Couldn’t get it working so when Amazon offered a small buy back I took advantage to get a new one. Hope this works better than the last one.,3
chrisc,Streaming video  quality,Streaming video quality  great,3
Merrill,works fine,"installed and works fine. We did have an issue with fire stick not going farther than select language screen because remote would not connect to fire stick at all. It turned out to be a silly reason why on their part, it was because we didn’t use the power cord that came with this particular fire stick!! we used the one from our previous 4k fire stick that looks exactly the same but, apparently it is oddly not on the inside.love the extra buttons, the live tv guide one is very handy. Would be great if in future the buttons where color coded and allowed us to program them with what app we want to automatically load..",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Excellent,Do not care for the hand remote,5
G. J. .Thomas,Excellent experience,"Setup was basically very easy.. You have to make sure the power cord is plugged in well. When the Fire TV starts, you have to choose the language first. After this, the process is straight fwd. When you are prompted to choose a service, you don't have to choose one at that time. You can skip the options like Disney or others and get past that screen to search for any services/apps not presented on that first screen. The speed of the controller, guide, search, and install apps is fast. The remote is small but works very well. I am very impressed with the options and ability to search for what you want.",3
Merlin’s Mom,Easy to use,"Because I made the mistake of using Verizon FIOS, my smart TV won't work without a FireStick, so I bought one.  FIOS won't allow smart TVs to work directly to the internet with the icons on the TV, so to stream cable channels and subscriptions services, a user is forced to buy this.  FYI - -  Comcast XFinity does NOT require this and I could use the icons straight on my smart tvs.To the point-- good product.  Easy to use.  Streams well.  One thing-- let me change channels from the remote and get to the guide from the Fire remote instead of having to go back to the Home screen and then select guide to change channels.",3
VetteDriver,NICE UPGRADE,"I've had 2 of the Fire TV Stick Lite devices for about 1 1/2 years. I loved the fact that I could finally, completely ""Cut the Cable""! I was paying $178 p/mth, without an added Premium Channels (HBO, NETFLIX, etc...).The only issue I had with the ""Lite"" version was the need of 3-Remotes to control everything (TV, Fire Stick and Soundbar). Spending $100. for a Universal Remote, was not an option.So, during October 2022 Prime Day Sale, I decided to upgrade to the Fire TV Stick 4K. I LOVE it! Not only do I get supported 4K content with amazing visual and sound quality, it also comes with an Updated Voice Remote that easily pairs with my Sony TV and iLive Soundbar. Now I can turn both On/Off and control the volume Up/Down and Mute. I can also use ""Alexa"" via my Echo Dot (4th Gen), for Hands-Free operation instead of the ""Alexa"" Integrated Remote. Makes life a little easier for me.I can't wait to see what Amazon Device Developers come up with next.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, to anyone that wants an Amazing Streaming Experience, that's easy to Setup and Easier on the Wallet than any Cable Company.",3
Goldee,Nice upgrade to regular stick,"Works very well for 4k streaming. Setup was simple because I indicated to sync my account with the new stick when I ordered so when I received it & hooked it up, everything just loaded.  I had to run update twice but that was nothing.  So after about 30 minutes everything was a go.  The only issue I ran into was that I lost my voice control. From what I found out, it is a glitch in the software, but I was able to find the solution on the internet.  Now everything works fine.  I like the upgrade & it was well worth it.",3
502 Hawkeye,Upgrade if you're having playback problems,"My old Firestick was outdated, video would halt just long enough to start back up and the voice track was then off. Was slow to navigate and just downright annoying. It didn't even dawn on me that the tech was outdated. When this one went on sale, I decided to give it a try. What a difference! Everything works great, no more halting, no more kicking me out of an app in the middle of a stream, quick navigation and easy to set up.",3
James R. Guy,Much faster than my smart tv!,"I am a travel nurse and am frequently moving between furnished houses in different cities, most of which have smart TVs that usually aren’t very smart. My Fire Stick comes with me everywhere I go, which makes it a breeze not having to sign in and out of my apps every time. Knowing how well they work, I ordered two more for my TVs back home (both of which are older, slower smart TVs that are missing some major streaming apps). Streaming through my TVs was always slow and glitchy, but the Fire Stick is such a fast and easy fix! Great quality picture, quick load times, easy navigation between apps, and all the apps I need! Don’t hesitate, just do it! PS it’s even better if you catch the Black Friday sale!",3
Diego,Last one to the party,"How many years has this thing been available? I'm a little older than I'd like to admit so I have stuck with tried and true options for most of my life. My skepticism bit me in the a$$ today. This thing is fantastic! About 10 dollars less than I paid for Chromecast back in the day (which I still use, nothing bad to say) and a whole lot more options. Allows me to download my cable provider's streaming app which eliminates the need for all those extra cable rental devices that I suspect the savvier crowd eliminated years ago. I won't bother to mention the other available apps as I'm sure I was the last guy on earth to discover this. Anyways, so far, it is excellent...I recommend, and even if it wasn't..25 bucks?, you spent more at Starbucks this morning. )",3
Pat C,Works great,"Works great. Not hard to set up. I was able to put the channels I subscribe to up top so I just click on them or use the mic.  I also realized it easier to go to the channel that you want and then search by voice once there. For instance. Voice search from the home page for Guy Fieri brought up one Season of one show. When I went to my Amazon Prime channel first and did a voice search from there, I found a least five shows of his. Anyway it's a great improvement on the old Roku I had. I didn't know you have to plug it in though. I thought the power would come from the TV. Not a big deal though I just use an extension cord to stretch it to the outlet.",3
Marian Richardson,must have internet service!,"Purchased & connected easily to a 6 yr old Samsung 55"" smart TV with only a basic generic subscription for local broadcast .. no premium channels .. which is part of & included from monthly HOA fees. With internet service & wifi the Firestick 4K opens up offering an abundance of available downloadable free apps offering various categories & many free viewing choices without the need to subscribe to satellite channels. All that is needed is internet. Follow included instruction sheet & start enjoying a wide range of available tv.. Links easily to tv and also with Amazon prime. Do be aware app storage is limited to less than 5mb of storage considering some apps seem to be permanently attached.",3
Bernice Barnett,Makes watching tv so much easier.,"If you don't have a smart tv then I would highly recommend the Fire stick. Its super easy to get to all of my favorite media apps so I can get to watching tv faster than ever. It's super easy to setup, and there's very little lagging when scrolling through apps. Voice control is a great feature as well, because its convenient to use when I cant reach for my remote.",3
Merrill,Love the fire stick wish it had lasted longer than 7 months.,Love the fire stick. Although this one  Only lasted 7 months.... we have bought 2 others they lasted longer.  But thats how it goes sometimes.  Definitely going to get another one. Because there nice to have..  have apps all on the stick . Sweet.  Can take with us when we go some were. What's not to love.,3
Mark R. Wietstock,Muy buen producto!,"Superó mis expectativa. Aunque al principio es algo difícil entender como funciona, después de que uno se acostumbra todo es sumamente sencillo.ADVERTENCIAS:  1) Si usted está en Latam y la cuenta Amazon está configurada para USA, las aplicaciones que descargue serán las versiones de USA y muchas no les van a funcionar, por ejemplo Paramount+, en este caso deberá conseguir en otra tienda de app la versión para Latam.  2) Si por alguna razón la cuenta Amazon vinculada es bloqueada, el dispositivo también se va a bloquear, deberá llamar a Amazon y pasar el interrogatorio de seguridad para desbloquear la cuenta y reactivar todos los dispositivos, incluyendo Tabletas, TVs, Echo, etc. (todo lo que sea mazon se bloquea). Si luego no se desbloquean automáticamnete, deberá comunicarse con soporte para que lo reinicien y deberá descargar y configurar todo de nuevo desde cero.  Fuera de esos dos detalles que aprendí en carne propia, el equipo vale la pena, las actualizaciones del SO y de las APPs se realizan automáticamente cuando no está en uso el dispositivo, fluye muy bien (poco lag), la imágen es muy buena, el sonido es bueno.  Alexa a veces funciona, aveces no, pero es bien sabido que en idioma castellano ella aún está aprendiendo, sin embargo es funcional y cuando ella no entiende algún comando que le damos, con utilizar algún sinónimo puede que si sea efectiva.  En definitiva lo recomiendo.",4
Ken Becker,using now with my LG TV,"I have an LG smart TV but still need to use this device.  The reason why is because for some strange reason, the LG content store is really bad meaning, it's missing a lot of apps, off the top of my head, I cannot get Fox Nation or paramount plus in the LG content.  This amazon fire device has all the apps including the fox nation and paramount plus app so I can watch my programs.  The remote easily pairs and I can use the fire remote to control the entire tv.",5
Todd P.,Works great,"My son brought his fire stick to my house when he came to recuperate from knee replacement.  He said that he also takes it on work trips as he uses it in the hotels.  I was impressed at how easy it was to get to Amazon and Netflix and several other platforms.  So I ordered two for myself, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  It is so much easier to use than I had expected and makes life more enjoyable. Worth the money, especially since the first one was on sale.",3
smitty653,Love it!!,This is my 6th one I have bought. I like this one the best of all. I really like Alexa in this remote. Great for the price. They can last so very long. All but one are still in use. I just keep adding them to all my t.v. In each room. Mine was the last room I put a t.v.in. I had never wanted to be someone who stayed in bed watching one for long. I liked being out in living room and basement. I love relaxing in my room now. I will keep on buying this product.,4
Willie S.,Best version of this brand so far!!!,Installation was smooth. Had to replace my very first Fire stick after 7+yrs of use. Have one in every room. This version is by far the best. It offered to install all the apps I had on the previous Fstick. Can only highly recommend to buy it. Would make a perfect stocking stuffer at this price.,4
viking,Easy set up,"Very easy to use, you hook it to your smart TV, the aps populate, and you log into the ones that are not free. Very easy, simple set up instructions, did it in about 5 minutes. Totally guided set up. You can do it! Just remember you have to pay for any of the aps that are not free. You do have to pay for prime video, peacock, some stuff is free if you have amazon prime but lots of it you have to pay for unless you upgrade your prime service.",4
Chipper,"So simple, Grandma can change programs with spoken words","WE ARE VERY PLEASED with the upgrades since the earlier version. This Fire TV Stick 4K can be setup in two minutes. If your TV has an open HDMI port and nearby USB port, you don't even need an electrical outlet. Plug it into your TV, then follow the instructions on the screen. The most complicated step is to switch the HDMI from cable TV to the HDMI with the Fire TV stick attached. We are impressed and will continue to upgrade as you bring out new versions.",4
Thomas Westerman,Great for the Road warrior,"I take it with me on business trips and plug it into  Hotel’s HDMI plug on LED TV’s.  One feature that would be better is battery power as sometimes TV’s do not have the additional USB outlet for power. Resolution is great. Controls easy to use. Plenty of Apps.@Amazon, probably a good idea to talk to Hotels and Airlines for easy plugins for screens for the Road Warriors among us and Make a battery powered version.",4
Barbara Gargano,Remote stops working.  Two died this way.  Cheap product,"There is a bug that bricks the remote in the latest version.  Dies mid use and never works again.Do NOT buy!Batteries, reset, and remote factory reset nothing works.They pushed a bad update and probably are seeing an increase in sales.Don't buy.  Class action law suit!",4
Mark Cautin,Staying connected,I would’ve liked it if we would’ve had a better instruction booklet describing how to record and how to race retrieve stuff you recorded because the one that came with it does not help at all not me anyway and then I mean I like the guy I love being able to see what’s coming on like the picture quality but every once a while it’s like it freezes and then when you go to Ford through it the ninth of things start moving again it’s like it really skips or sometimes you’re sitting here and as I could all of a sudden it’s loses connection you got the picture and you got that thing sent their twirling in the center and then I’ll send it to connect again but yet I have Internet on everything else,4
Carl Dyess,Each generation gets a little better,"This is a mature technology at this point.  Quick, responsive, without profound lags.  I've recently decided to give up being nervous about privacy and embrace Alexa, and on this device it works quite well: hears me clearly, and translates my spoken words to accurate searching.If you have an older Fire Stick, I suggest an upgrade.  If you don't, give it a try at these low prices.",4
Merrill,Super Easy,"I now have 5 of these and love how easy they are to install, setup, and the Alexa works great too.  We recently cut the cord from cable and so far it has been working great.  The Wi-Fi reception range seems pretty decent too, we bought a projector and watch movies in the back yard.  So far no connectivity issues.  👍🏻👍🏻",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Enchance your 4-8K TV,Can't say enough about this product. I was skeptical at first always having a mini PC connected to my TV for streaming my HTPC. The Amazon Fire Stick 4K was seamless in integration. My Samsung TV picked up the Fire Stick after installing and then proceeded to tie in the Home Theater Receiver so I only have one remote.  It also upscaled the TV resolution to the 4k it should be. My cable company doesn't give me that resolution!  The sound and picture are what they should be now.  I bought three more for my other televisions.,4
Skip Alexander,Superior Product,"This Amazon Fire Stick is simply amazing.  It turns a Flat Screen Television almost to a Fire Television smart device.  Really it has Alexa which is always brilliant and will help you browse through the menus. Setting up is a breeze.  Just plug the Amazon Fire Stick into the HDM1 port and you are on your way.  It hooks up through the internet, so you will need that.  It has movies through Amazon Prime Videos, so plan on spending about a little bit of money on that. Some videos you will have to rent or buy for such a small fee.  Other Videos (and there are a lot of them) are free as long as you are a member of Amazon Prime Video.  Freeve and Pluto networks you can access through the Amazon Fire Stick and they are splendid networks and they free.  They have a lot of great shows and movies to offer, as well as CNN news.  The remote is superior which has a button you can press to talk with Alexa and she will help you navigate through the menus to access Amazon Prime, Freeve and Pluto networks.  I do not know if all the Amazon Fire Sticks have Alexa or not on the remote so make sure you get the correct one with Alexa.  There are other content you can access through the Amazon Fire Stick with Alex's help.  Netflix and Hulu are a couple from others that are too numerous to mention here.  Also, you have to open a free Amazon account.",4
KR,You don't have to be in the 'Alexa EcoSystem' to make the most of this!,I picked up the revised firestick after trading in my original stick which had grown somewhat dated. The new revision offers an overhauled remote (onboard audio and power control for compatible TV's + soundbars). The streaming consistency and quality is great even on my fairly poor connection and the device offers a great array of streaming services onboard that don't restrict you to any proprietary platforms. This replaced an original generation Apple TV in my home as I am predominately on the HomeKit ecosystem and I found that all my third party accessories were either compatible with Alexa integration as well and the experience was still fluid casting between my appleOS devices and the firestick. Would definitely recommend as a cost effective alternative to other leading streaming devices. My only caveat is that using the firestick includes a TV set up process that was not able to properly set up IR controls with cheaper TV's and projectors I had tested it on.,5
GKR,Lo debí haber comprado antes,"Hasta el momento me encanta el dispositivo, toda mis familia y conocidos han usado el Roku como primera opción, opte por el Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K y estoy encantado, me gusta su interfaz es atractiva y me gusto el orden que tiene.La resolución de películas y series es excepcional, nada que envidiar de los Roku y su integración con Alexa me encanta, no es común que ocupe los comandos de voz pero es súper funcional!!! Y sobre todo el extensor que trae por defecto fue lo que me salvo, de no ser el, mi TV no hubiese permitido insertar el dispositivo directamente!!Esto es un 10 de 10!!! Recomendado",3
Renarda Salmon,It's made my smart TV even smarter.,"We live in an area with limited internet options and because of data caps we have never been able to do much streaming.  Recently we were able to upgrade to a service with unlimited data so we can now use more streaming services. Our TV is an older Insignia model.  It's ""smart"" but apparently not quite smart enough because it picks up Netflix and Amazon Prime but would not get Disney Plus or Apple plus.  So I took a chance on the Fire Stick.  It works like a charm.  I plugged it into an HDMI port on the back of the tv, connected it to power, and fired it up.  Using the input button on the tv remote the tv found the fire stick without issue and I was easily able to connect Disney Plus and Apple Plus.  It also connected to Alexa without any problems and we can control some functions with either our Echo Show or directly through the remote which has an Alexa button.  The sound and picture quality is very good.  There are only a couple of minor issues that are certainly no big deal.  The fire stick itself would not plug directly into the HDMI port because the adjacent ports both have things plugged into them and the stick would not fit.  So I had to use the little HDMI extension cable which was included apparently because of this very issue.  It works perfectly but it does stick out a little and so the stick is visible from behind the tv which is no big deal at all for us.  Also, we have Dish.  So now, to successfully run the tv, we need three remotes.  The Dish remote, the tv remote, and the Fire Stick remote.  Again, this is simple and not a big deal.  Overall we are extremely pleased with the Fire Stick.",4
aek,Works fine.  Same as  my other Fire Sticks,"I only bought the 4K Fire Stick because my LG 65C1 OLED TV does not support the NBA League Pass app.  I could say that this is an indictment of my LG  TV's smaller subset of available apps, as much as praise for the fire stick.I use this fire stick along with the Amazon ethernet adapter for it. It works fine, as advertised, although I only use it for a very limited application.  I do not use voice commands so I cannot evaluate them.My only complaint with all of the fire sticks is they are not backlit.  I like to watch TV at night with the lights out, so if I need to issue streaming changes, I have to turn a light in the room on to see what I am doing.",4
Imasiberian,That sometimes it works and sometimes it don't!,"My emotions are very mixed about this device when I first used it.it was perfectly fine, now I notice that it's taking a lot longer to get a movie going and I noticed that the little logo that swirls around and  round on your TV screen has been swirling for 10 minutes now! and nothings happening so I'm kind of confused about this product it seems like my old fire stick which only veiws  in HD works better.At first I thought it was my Internet service not being able to handle 4K HD  UHD but I called my Internet service and they told me I have the fastest Internet available known to mankind so now I'm even more confused? The aliens were right I think we are depending too much on electronics and I think it is going to be the end of mankind. Because when my streaming service doesn't work like it's supposed to it feels like it's the end of the world! when I was a kid the end of the world was not being able to see Star Wars for the 200 time now it seems like the end of the world is not being able to stream Star Wars in 4K for the first time!GOD WHATS THIS WORLD COMING TOO?",4
Amazon Customer,Faster than connecting directly through the Smart TV,"Hulu was no longer supported on my Smart TV so I bought a Firestick. Now, I run all my apps through the Firestick because it connects much faster than going directly through the TV. I don't use Alexa or voice features, so I just gave it 3 stars.",4
William Grajal,Really impressive for $25,"I know this Fire TV Stick has been out since 2018, but it's still a relevant performer.  I'm using it on a 32"" 1080p TV and it looks great.  Menu navigation is is quick and responsive.  I have no idea how/if Amazon is making any profit at $25 per unit.",4
jamilou,Good purchase,I updated my older version of a Fire stick. I like that it can be voice activated and with the push of a button can open a number of streaming services- all features my older stick lacked.Works great with the 6 streaming services we use.,4
Eric NC,So much better,"Replace my old firestick (which I didn't think had a problem, but it was suggested it would make a big difference)  Well, it made a huge difference.  Quicker response, I think a better image and I am very happy with it!",4
Merrill,Love our new firestick!,This is awesome! We had an apple tv and switched to the firestick. It is so much cheaper. The quality seems great. Really nice picture and is fast. I was a die hard apple tv user but this has me changing my mind.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Totally worth the upgrade better connectivity volume on remote etc,"Totally worth the upgrade the connectivity is better, volume and buttons for main apps on remote saves a lot of time. The fire stick allows me to save a considerable amount of money as an alternative to outrageous expensive cable bills!",4
Jack,Works Good,Was very easy to set up. Linked to my amazon account without an issue and reinstalled all the apps I use. Able to adjust volume on TV & turn on/off. So nice to have 1 remote instead of 2 now.,4
Gregory Toscano,100% better than the Roku Ultra I have.,The Fire TV stick 4K is much better than the Roku Ultra that I have been using. I like it so much that I bought a second one for another TV in the bedroom. No trouble with losing audio or picture freezing up like with the Roku.,4
JACK W,100% recomendado para TV viejas,Excelente producto. Pude darle una segunda vida a una TV antigua. Fue un regalo para mi familia y les encanto. La calidad de audio y video son muy buenas. Me encantan las aplicaciones de pluto TV y VIX se sienten como tener cable pero gratis. Volvería a comprar el producto. Si tienes una TV o un monitor viejo te funcionará para darle una segunda vida.Nice product. It s a second chance for old devices.,5
Grill,Happy.  Used to access Xfinity Stream after they stopped supporting on LG Smart TV,Bought an LG smart TV that supported the Xfinity Stream App which was then discontinued shortly after.  ANNOYING but that's Comcast.  Got the fire stick since we do not have a cable line to this TV and can't get one.  So far we're very happy.  Actually gave us more functionality!  It recognized our small sound-bar so we don't have to use two remotes anymore.  Bonus we weren't expecting.  Don't really use the alexa functionality because it's easier to just speak to the actual echo.  Can't seem to find a need to use via the TV.  It doesn't work within the Xfinity app that we can figure (but maybe we're missing something).  Just wish we didn't have to take up a plug for it but not the end of the world.,3
Gabriel ,Fire tv,I already have one just needed another for livingroom... grandkids don't want to be in bedroom all the time and I need to stay out of the bed. This works great..cheaper than paying for satellite or cable. Just have to worry about internet bill.,4
Diana,Excellent service,"This review is about customer service ,I received the firestick and it said I needed my password to amazon and I also wasn't sure I could set the product  up ,so I called c.s ,I asked them to call me back day later to help with install ,well the lady called back almost 10 minutes of when I asked ,I was able to do all myself before she called ,but kudos to the c.s. agent for her excellent follow through ,amazon and staff are the greatest",4
PM,Helps extend the life of you Smart TV!,"The apps on our smart tv are glitchy. Instead of buying a new TV, I got the fireTV on sale and works great. I love the voice recognition for searching for movies. Paired easily with my TV.",4
Joni Babylon,This remote does it all!!,"We finally cut the cord from cable.  Very happy with this fire stick.Will probably replace the “older” Roku we are using in the Great Room. Tired of having to deal with the 2 remotes. The TV remote to turn on/off and control the sound AND the ROKU remote to change channels! Just FYI, we are happy with YouTubeTV too.",4
Mike Cooper,"Awesome device for streaming, exceeded expectations","My Vizio TV had a really crappy remote that wasn’t even working anymore. I bought this in hopes that it could make my TV work again and it did! Just by connecting the Fire stick, I can use the fire tv remote to turn on my TV and use all the features (including volume). It’s also really convenient to take with you when traveling since it’s so small. I think it’s better than a Roku.The features also exceeded my expectations. It has all apps I could think of: Spotify, YouTube, all major streaming apps, an internet browser, games made by Amazon, Twitch, TikTok, and more. The voice recognition also works pretty well and reduces how much typing you have to do.",4
Aaron Grandison,Nice,"Got this to replace my original Firestick. I was a little upset that the last one started acting up, but they are not expensive and the quality of streaming on this one is so much better",4
Merrill,Hot or miss with Dolby atmos,The reason for my rating is because this device doesn’t work with Dolby atmos for majority of applications. I can only seem to get atmos to work on Apple TV app all the other apps it’s just Dolby digital plus. Pretty disappointed.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,New development with best quality of streaming,"I love to stream the movie, YouTube etc. the new 4K max is a real piece of best streaming product with more bigger storage and the convenience of the remote that can do more than it used to be.Such as pair with your tv volume and few one touch to your favorite streaming media.  Awesome product and reliables",4
lmcrue,Watch anything,"I bought this for my daughter & her husband, they watched a YouTube video to unlock it, & they’ve been watching anything & everything they can. It’s really good & if you don’t have 1, I suggest to definitely get one!",4
Sodypop,Upgrade was Worth It,"I've had many version of the Fire Stick going back to the original. Seems I get a couple of years out of them then they have connectivity issues. Noticed when we upgraded to a 4K TV the older version was sluggish. Once we installed this one all our problems went away. As a cord cutter, I really appreciate how ecomonical Prime and the Fire Sticks are. One year of prime is same as I paid for 1.5 months of DirectTV. If looking to upgrade from an older version, I can say yes it's worth it.",4
barden,Worth the upgrade,Worth the upgrade I keep this with me for travel so that I can always have my own channels available. This has been the easiest fire stick so far. Worth the upgrade to get the voice control and the picture quality is excellent. It comes with an extender for the HDMI to television hook up which is great.,4
Gerald Gustafson,So much better than my old Blu-ray for streaming!  Why did I wait?!,"Why did I wait?  For the half off sale!  This little gadget is super easy to set up and use.  I like that I’m now just using the one small remote.  Lots of streaming choices, more than on my old Blu-ray.  I’m not using the voice/Alexa option now, but it’s nice to know it’s available.  Good product.  Fast delivery.  Happy camper.",5
PameLaDeDah,My go to device,"This does exactly what I need it to do as I try to cut the cord.  I have a few of these devices and I am extremely satisfied.  I had a Google cast first but has since replaced it.  It does not work as well for me, so I will stick with this device.",3
Rafael antunez,Firesticks are THE BEST devices.. better than Roku hands down,"As a home theater installer, I have gotten very familiar with several different streaming devices. After getting multiple defective Rokus, I went with a Firestick 4k. I'm never using anything else (except perhaps a Max) from here on. I have 3 in the house and with 100Mbps wifi, they all work fluidly simultaneously. SO much faster than any competitor when selecting apps and 4k programming. Roku simply can't compete.",4
Bill,Reboot,Have had to  reboot several times. Unplug plug back in. In saying that it's not the stick but local internet service. Had had to upgrade yet but is a possibility in the future.,4
mateo francisco,Upgrade today,"We had been waiting to upgrade because I didn't want to have to reformat the stick with the apps and passwords. Our old stick just didn't have enough memory left and it would lag in opening apps. The new one is such an upgrade. It loads without delay. The quick buttons are nice. It formated itself with the apps we already had. We did have to link them using a code and re-enter user names and passwords. Even though that was annoying, it is worth the time in having the processing speed and functionality.",4
Gerardo Castillo,EXCELLENT STREAMING DEVICE,"I USED TO USE THE REGULAR FIRE STICK BUT.....now i use only the 4k its really a diferent story, is super fast and you can play 4k content.i really recommend this little device",4
Wetracing,Upgraded when old one failed,"Had to upgrade.  Our old one burned out (it was about 3 years old).  One plus on this model is that we can use the volume control.  We have a sound bar and had to use a separate remote (so we had three remotes, which was a pain).  Now we have two, one for the streaming and one for the local channels.",4
Merrill,Works well on older Vizio TV to get Amazon Prime Video.,"I was using an older Sony Blu-Ray DVD player for Netflix on our pre-smart Vizio LCD HDTV, but firmware/software would not support/update to Amazon Prime Video app.  Fire Stick installation, setup and registration went smoothly.  Have not set up voice recognition (yet) nor Alexa, so no rating.  Just using standard 1080P high-definition and works well over 50MB internet connection.  Nice thing about using the Firestick is getting Thursday Night Football over Prime...for some reason my ""newer"" Vizio TV's Prime Video software won't support this programming - maybe need a firmware update....  App menu systems/navigation are different between hardware types - Firestick is easier to navigate.",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Great product!,Works exactly as expected. My aunt lost the remote to her large tv and it’s a bit older and isn’t a smart tv. This device helped retro fit her outdated tv into a high quality smart tv. We’re very happy with the purchase. She even shut off her cable subscription to use the streaming services and saved about $50 a month.,4
Jorge,The Amazon Firestick is awesome!,I really enjoy the Amazon firestick. My Uncle Leroy has it now on his television and it is so easy to use. The variety of television shows and movies available are incredible!,4
James Mills,Incredible features,This is the second 4K Fire Stick I've purchased and I can now stream a wide selection of movies and tv programs. The integration with Alexa was effortless and the picture quality on my Samsung 4K and UHD sets are amazing. I am considering dumping Sling since the Fire Sticks offer so much more and include local channels.,4
Tony  Wray,"Great, new product for me",I got this as a replacement for one that I purchased elsewhere that stopped working and since it was an Amazon product they were really great about sending me a new one.,4
Denis,My 4k firestick,"Since my dog Tyler seems to have an affinity to fire stick remotes, I’ve had 4 now, I finally grabbed 4k and it is really really great. I’ve solved the problem with Tyler… I place the remote in a dark place on to of the tv. For now, all is good!!! Thank you Amazon Prime. 😆",4
Natalie,Easy Installation,What I liked the most was how easy it was to install this on my tv.  My tv is already hanging on the wall and I didn't have the physical strength to take it down.  It was so simple to add this to the back of my television (I hate cords).,5
STEPHANIE B FAIR,A Must Have make to your tv and smart tv,"Really happy with this device, internet is fast and really easy to set up, if you have prime and like to stream movies this is the one to buy",3
Tim Bergquist,Great option if you want to cut the cord,"I purchased two fire sticks to replace a satellite feed we had.  Now no more expensive monthly fees, no box rentals, no maintenance fees, just free tv. The Amazon Fire Stick comes loaded with content and you can download lots of apps for either streaming tv or movies. All in all I wish I had done this sooner.",4
Richard Huacon,Nobody told me how fantastic this is,I’m sooooo late to buying this. Got one for my grandma so she could eliminate cable ($300+) a month. Now she only has to pay for internet and she can watch all the movies and shows she wants. I’ve gotten one as well because I fell in love with it. Super happy!!!,4
Keith Dumont,OMG It has a screen reader!,The Fire TV stick comes with a screen reader for people who are blind or visually impaired. It's also possible to switch audio tracks to tracks that contain audio descriptions.I'm legally blind from birth. I'm just accustomed to missing visual information when watching TV or movies. A lot of Prime video and Netflix content has audio descriptions. It was so exciting to start setting up this device and find out that I can fully use it.,4
Nana15,Upgraded and Worth It!,We had an older version of the Firestick and had to upgrade recently due to the Beachbody App not working with the older one. This newer version works great. We love the features of the quick access to Netflix and Disney+. I'm going to upgrade our other ones as well.,4
Merrill,Great!,I replaced one of the original stick in the kitchen tv that stopped working. This new version is superior to all the others I own (I have 4).,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Great for the price,"So far everything ok. Nice for the price, made good, good fit, looks nice. I would buy it again, I'm happy with it and it did meet my expectations.",4
Michelle ,Alien tech is awesome,"This is perfect for traveling and staying at hotels. Phone HotSpot will work on this device. If you want to play games, you will need a BT game controller. I love alien tech.",4
Clauginia Francis,No more cable,I am so happy with this fire stick. It is saving me over $142 on cable. I cut the cord and couldn’t be happier. The picture quality and sound are so much better.,4
Chad B.,good upgrade,"We have multiple firesticks and rokus.  All the rokus are 4K.  None of the firesticks were.  Makes no real difference on smaller tvs, but definitely see the difference in a large screen.  We bought this to replace a firestick that was probably close to 10 years old.",4
Wilson Chow,Love the fire TV stick,"Just bought this other 4K FIre TV stick for the bedroom TV. I really like the overall look of the OS, over any pre-installed TV operating system. The Fire TV is fast, never had any issues with it. It does everything that I need to enjoy my streaming programs.",4
nick karras,Firestick 4k,I had one minor obstacle while pairing. I had another Bluetooth device operating in close proximity. I had to temporarily turn the other device off while pairing was completed. I was then able to turn the other device back on with no problems. Otherwise every thing works great.,4
Soular ,Great product,Fire stick has great streaming qualities and I would really enjoy it more if we had better internet connectivity where I live. This is No fault on the fire stick. I have a Verizon box and a data plan that limits me to what I can watch.,5
Yessenia Acosta,Great streaming!,It was easy to set up. The streaming is great I haven’t had any issues with it loading. My tv is older and not a 4k tv but works great.,3
Ski,really good product!,"I bought it as a gift for my parents. I think my parents like it a lot. Parents like to watch videos on YouTube, Netflix, etc., and I really recommend this product. I think this product is really suitable as a gift for parents. Strongly recommend.",4
LOVE305,Device Much Faster With More Choices Than IPTV Device,"I like the number of entertainment options available on the Amazon Fire Stick verses my standard IPTV device installed by Broadstar Internet.  There are many free services but also many paid ones I wouldn’t have access to.I also find the Fire Stick to be much faster.  Some options on my IPTV remote don’t work with the device making it uncomfortable to use.  Everything on the Fire Stick works.  I haven’t tried Voice or Alexa, so I can’t rate that.",4
CFCH,I’m a fan,"I am a Firestick fan. When they first came out, I brought them from the first edition all the way up until now and continue to use them because I am a fan so my review may be a little biased but I love these things.",4
Merrill,What a difference,"Didn't think there would be a big difference from my old firestick but woe! Huge difference. Better speed, quality if pic etc. Impressive. Love my firesticks.",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Works awesome,"I had a very old Fire Stick (like 8+ years?) and we were trying to use it on a TV that was pretty far from the router. Assumed it was just our terrible internet, but it turns out it was the crazy old Fire Stick LOL. Ordered this, plugged it in, short setup and boom we were in business. Works awesome, so much better than we were expecting (with our terrible internet).",4
Mysra,Great investment,"My TV is already smart but it’s slow and has a ton of obscure apps. I decided to buy this to use instead as a smart feature. It’s fast, has exactly the app buttons I want, and is so easy to use. Love it!",4
Roman,It is the go-to for entertainment,"We use this with our TV at home and when we travel. We also use it for backyard movies with a projector. This keeps all of our paid and free accounts and options easily accessible wherever we are. So easy to use…just plug into a USB port in the viewing device. Especially handy if your TV is a little dated- you don’t need a new TV and software, just use this.",4
Dmv1022,Love it!,I love how easy it set up. The quality of the video is flawless. I replaced my firestick and my only regret is that I waited to long. I recommend buying this. My fire stick was easy to set up because I already have a prime account. All I had to do was plug in my fire stick and everything loaded.,4
John R Wilmot,Kids Mode Beware,"Love that this has so many upgraded features from our older Fire TV model (the little square box that plugs in). If you have multiple devices, it recognizes and helps you set them up. Then you can use the voice feature to switch between inputs. The volume/mute on the remote. And the easy access for certain apps on the remote.Downsides mostly with Kids Mode accounts with Prime. Some of the purchases I previously made (for kids) will not show up as an option on the kid's account. Theres no way to put favorites at the top for easy access. Prime Kids is across the top no matter what, so if you don't pay for Prime Kids, the icons all have Lock icons, and your kids keep asking if you can unlock them. Also the voice button won't work on kid's mode. Back to the switching inputs. If you were on a kid's mode, then switched devices  (ie. Some devices auto switch inputs on your TV just by turning them on), you cannot use the voice mode to return input back to FireTV. Because voice mode is deactivated. So keep your TV remote handy.",4
William Tetrault,Much faster than my last Fire stick.,"these things are great, we completely got rid of cable, there are a ton of options for free or subscription services.  I have noticed that they seem to get glitchy over time; I replace them when on sale... not a deal breaker.",4
robert torrez,So easy to setup and use!,"I bought this because the box I normally use had some update hiccups; I concluded this would be a good Plan B. Because I am a Prime member, all of my Amazon stuff was already loaded and setup was as easy as plugging it into the wall socket and the TV HDMI. Then it just worked! I added my other streaming services with ease and now I am wondering why I did not just buy this initially. My compliments to Amazon tech development.",4
BroWeeble214,"Awesome, just some minor glitches sometimes.","Remote is comfortable but too simple, perhaps a few more sound options and more apps. Voice search is too sensitive or dont give the right results. For the price it is a great buy, streaming is good and its easy to use",5
C. Melton,Couldn’t be easier !,I lost the remote to my Firestick.  The only thing I can think is I accidentally tossed it when I tidied up newspapers What a pain.  So I got on Amazon to order another.  Couldn’t have been easier or faster delivery.  It was here in a couple of hours (hours not days!).  And Amazon even had it set up for tv.  Just had to plug it in.  That’s all I had to do.  I like this one much better than the old one.  Better streaming and features.  And it was on sale half price!  Thank you Amazon.,3
Alexander,The easiest set-up ever!!,"It took only a few minutes to set up and the remote paired up to my TV by itself!  It was amazing!!  The interface is so easy to navigate, beautiful clear display, and the remote controls the TV power and volume - everybody needs one of these!!",4
Robert Heuston,So glad I updated!,"I asked a question on here… was it necessary to upgrade your equipment or did it upgrade itself. I got some good and bad advice. The answer is..  although your equipment does upgrade its self when needed, like all electronics, there comes a time when you absolutely DO have to purchase upgraded equipment. I had one of the first, if not the first Firesticks. Most everything was buffering to the point that it was impossible to watch, especially the newer streaming apps. Long story short, after trying lots of other things that failed to fix the issue, it turned out to be my old outdated Firestick. I purchased this one, hook up was easy, and like magic… no more issues with streaming at all! No more buffering, no more resetting. WORKS PERFECT AND SOLVED ALL THE PROBLEMS. And, NO, you don’t have to have Alexa unless you want the voice activation feature. I don’t have have and don’t want or need it. Hope this helps.",4
Merrill,Works well,"I bought this to use on my non smart tv in my bedroom.  Set up was easy.  My internet connection can be spotty at times but I've not had any problems streaming my favorite shows.  My remote also controls the volume and power which my cable remote would not do, even after programming it.  Definitely will purchase again for other non smart tvs.",4
Mark R. Wietstock,Excelente servicio de Streaming,Recomendado al 100% para aquellas personas que necesiten una interfaz más amigable para el streaming en casa y como asistente de voz,4
vickie,Very easy to use,Bought this to use on a vacation so I didn’t have to deal with signing into all the apps on the resort tv. It works great. Very easy to set up. Found the Wi-Fi and signed in and away we go.,4
Michaella Jones,You can control tv on same remote now!,I love all the features in this version of an already great streaming device. You can control the volume and on/off on your tv with this one. I really like how good Alexa is on here as well!! 5 Stars!!!,4
Amazon Customer,Really liking the Fire Stick,"The software on the Fire stick is upgrades from what I have on my television. They basically do the same thing but, Fire Stick has internet. Very cool. The Alexa integration is very nice as well. I love being able to speak commands instead of long and drawn out typing on the screen keypad. Mmm, what else can I think of. I don't think the layout is better than previous versions but it's okay. My older system is simpler and easier to navigate. Oh, the internet application is called Silk. I think that about covers it. Lastly is because the software is relatively new it's robust. There's very little lag time and that makes you feel like things are ""as they should be.""I guess that's my review of 🔥 Stick guys. Take it easy and look out for other reviews on other products.",4
Robert G.,Works great!,Easy to install. I even hooked it up to my Roku TV with no problems at all. Stream quality is amazing. Integrated with all my other Alexa items with no problems at all. I have an echo 5 in my home and once I plugged the fire stick I’m and fired it up it was almost as if it was set up for me. I had to do nothing. As soon as I fired the fire stick up there was my name already on the screen already set up with my items and all that. Seamless. Would recommend to everyone.I find the interface to be a little more jumbled up than say the Roku interface. A little busier I think is the right word. So if you’re used to the Roku straightforward and simple interface this may take some getting used to. But completely doable and after awhile you’re scaling through the options with no problem. But it looks cleaner than the Roku’s kind of cartoonish look and backgrounds. I’d say it looks more adult or executive in a sense.Enjoy!,4
Karen Bateman,Es un producto de excelente calidad,"Llegó la envoltura pero no el producto, me sorprende que el repartidor no se percatara de que la funda estuviera abierta y vacía, porque se notaba muy claro la abertura. Gracias amazon por reponer el producto y enviarlo, es perfecto.",4
AmazonShopper,Great price,I’ve had a fire stick for quite a few years and needed a new one this one is much better then the other one I had I can control the power and volume of my tv with this one,4
Dawn,Just chef kisses !,Honestly money spent right . I give this a high review . Everything is so nice and a decent price . Stream all you like and whatever you like. I absolutely love this . There’s nothing bad to say about it . Also way much cheaper than cable . All you need is wifi and normal Amazon account and your set to go. I save a lot of money with this than when I had cable. My whole family can enjoy movie night now . Alexa works amazing .,4
nfc,ng. Speech enabled♥️,Perfect. Speech enabled. I was tired of typing. Great for seniors (which I am) my son did set it up and got me started streaming ♥️,5
Anderson Arguello,Always The Best,Needed an upgrade for my fire stick and this one is perfect! Pairs well and doesn’t lose connection with internet! 10 out of 10 would recommend!,3
Jose Cosme,Easy to install.,I replaced an old original version of the Fire Stick. This model is an improvement. Very easy to install and works well.,4
Merrill,Not sure it’s easy to use than Roku. Could not  connect to my spectrum provider,It was not as easy to navigate as Roku. Couldn’t connect to my spectrum provider. Tried casting and failed. Downloaded a casting app but still failed to connect. I finally gave up and bought a newer version of Roku and I’m much happier with my choice,4
Mark R. Wietstock,"What? Free TV? Yes said fire stick, and it's true!","Easy to connect. Then enjoy hundreds of channels free of cost, and those annoying commercials. Thank you fire stick. You're fabulous.",4
Vance,A nice upgrade,"We have used both Roku and Fire Sticks for our streaming needs for the last few years and I purchased this as an upgrade for our old Fire Stick. The set up was easier than prior sticks and the interface is smoother. I appreciate having TV controls on one remote, especially because I also have a sound bar attached. Strongly recommend over other streaming options.",4
mtt61,Fire Stick,We bought this Fire stick to replace our old one.  The new one is so much better.  My old one didn't have volume control and this one navigates with the greatest of ease.  Would repurchase.,4
Brian Frayne,Great 👍!,"Too bad everything doesn't work as well as these do, I love em! All the free tv you can get and apps, etc for the price can't be beat! Easy to connect to tv and wifi and then start using in just 20 minutes or so! I've got them on 3 tvs and they all work perfectly even when they're all playing at the same time. Great purchase, would buy again and would very much recommend!",4
Robert King,It remembers your internet connection & login credentials for online accounts,"SUGGESTION FOR AMAZON:It would be great if the ""keyboard"" had a button that takes you into a window/screen where you could save your commonly used email addresses.  Not just the existing built-in ""@gmail"" etc.  So that you could store several family/visitor member email addresses that are associated with various Login streaming account.  It sucks having to retype the same email address repeatedly.The volume control overrides our main TV/System converter, which is good.The Netflix & Hulu built-in buttons are very handy.We needed an HDMI hub (4 slots) to make this work with our system.",4
WarHokie,Great option for streaming,Very easy to use and setup. All the apps you would need and more. Also if your tv is mounted on the wall there is an adapter you can use to create more room to the side.,4
Maureen,Great TV Fire Stick 4K,"Easy to use/install new TV Fire Stick to replace older TV Firestick.  Amazon retained a couple of the Apps that were on the old Fire Stick.  It was easy to reinstall to the new stick.  Also, New TV stick was able to sync up with the TV and soundbar.  New remote able to turn on/off TV and control volume on the sound bar.  Alexis working well on the TV.",4
Brant Florea,Best Decision to Ditch Cable Ever!,"was debating on ditching my cable company for a long long time- was a bit nervous that I would loose out on some local stations- but this turned out to be the BEST decision ever to get rid of my cable, that high monthly bill and feel FREE!  was a little intimidated at first as I was new to streaming, but it turned out to be so very easy and the set up was super easy as well. I have had NO PROBLEMS since it arrived on my doorstep- looking to get rid of an extra monthly bill- GET THIS... JUST DO IT! you know you have been waiting for it for a long time.",4
Jeffrey J Graczyk,Replace a Cable Box,I know we are some of the last people with cable but we like it. To save some money we purchased this and put the xfinity stream app on it. Return a box and save some cash.,4
epernas,Love it!,I haven't tried any of the extra features yet. I just love how easy it is to plug in and access all my favorite streaming options. This replaced Direct TV for us and I couldn't be happier.,5
Cindy,Works Great!,I had to get something to work with my older tv that couldn’t get the right apps. This works great to get everything you need and the remote makes it all so much easier. Plus using it with Alexa is a great plus to extend one’s laziness even further down the rabbit hole. But it’s great for those moments for when needed.,3
Merrill,Works really good!!!,This product was so amazing I’ve been using it for about four months now and the quality was great,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Where have you been all this time!,Upgraded to this fire stick and sooo worth it. Works very well and it’s so fast. I wish I would have gotten this sooner.,4

Amazon Customer,Happy Cable Cutter,My 4K Fire Stick delivers the highest quality image I’ve ever had on my Samsung 4K Smart TV.  With YouTube TV as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime…can’t be beat.  Dump cable and satellites!!,4
Harold Dominguez,Great way to watch TV,Much improved quality over previous model streams better remote adapts easily and it’s a lot cheaper then other devises,4
Rich W,Faster than Roku,"We have the Vizio smart TV and Roku. The firestick is faster and easy to use! Fast download of apps and easy sign ins. The shortcuts on the remote are more what we use, as well.",4
Judy,Worth updating to get this one,"I'm buying these for our other two TVs. I love that I don't need a separate remote to turn off and on or control volume. This moves swiftly to the appropriate app, much faster than my old Fire Stick. The only thing I would like to change is if I could have buttons for the apps I want, so I could exchange the Disney button for a Paramount Plus button.",4
M H.,I like this but i havent used it yet,"I have not used this yet, but I do have a fire stick and I really like it",4
Idan Bianco,Thank you very much the item is working good,I am very satisfied with the item thank you very much everything is working real well thank you,5

Steve McGrath,Great price,"Black Friday deal, Fire Stick were 50% off. Thats a great price so I purchased 2.",4
edward gary robinson,"Amazon fire stick is the best, you can watch anything on TV","I like having no cable bill, I can watch anything on TV plus pay per view with Amazon fire stick, what a good product to have its the best thing for you if you now how to use it",4
Paula Carrell,Love it!,I love having this in my bedroom and it was just $25. Great deal!,4
Sherman Geiter,Better than expected,My 2015 LEd tv become smart just one controller for allI love it,4
Merrill,Easy to Set UP,I read many reviews that gave the horror stories of setting this up and I almost didn't purchase it for that reason.  I went out on a limb and bought the Fire Stick.  Keep in mind I do not mess with tech stuff at all because I hate it and struggle with it.  This was easy enough for me to set up on my own.,5
Mark R. Wietstock,This streaming device works great!!,"My older TVs didn’t seem compatible with many new apps so this unit was affordable and compatible with my other Alexa equipment. I don’t use the Alexa capability but the operation is simple and reliable for a huge amount of streaming content. I bought a second unit for the bedroom so we can pause and restart in the other room if needed. As you can see, I highly recommend this equipment and Amazon has great deals on the units.",3

CT Brother,100% recomendable,"La mejor inversion que uno pueda hacer. Facil de usar, tiene todo lo necesario para no pagar cable.",4
Dave,Fun for me,"Why did I not get this a long time ago?  Lots of free channels.  Some apps do require a subscription.  Better than having to buy a ""package"" of channels and content you'll never watch from the big entertainment companies.  You choose what you enjoy and not required to watch unnecessary.I recommend it!  Have not used Alexa yet.  Alexa is not required to use this entertainment product.",4
David,Easy to set up,I use the firestick on my tv that is older. The quality of the picture is really good. I have been able to download all my channels and be able to find them very easy,4
Mike S,Justo lo que pedi,"La integración con Alexa es perfecta, muy fácil de configura y utilizar",4

I went to the best place I knew I could count  on getting it quickly, in great packaging. I can’t say anything bad about anything I have ordered from Amazon. It is good to get it there on time. If I have any problems they handle it.",4
Merrill,First Experience,First time buying a firestick. I'm enjoying all the features. Great buy.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,NO private Listening Volume controls..,"Ok I bought this Fire TV Stick 4K awhile ago out of curiosity in comparing it to my Roku's.. I did not use it for awhile but lately I have been making myself learn more about it and the differences.. everything has been good until last night.. I use private listening in the evenings both to not disturb others and I have some hearing loss and it is easier for me.. So.. i tried private listening with the Fire Stick and after some searching I got to it and it works fine, except.. Some genius at Amazon, decided there was no need of any volume controls. that is very irritating and is a deal breaker for me and the fire stick.. back to the shelf with it and probably will at some point get given away.  NO VOLUME CONTROLS.. Genius..Ok .. edit part.. I did contact Anazon on the issue when I realized I had 2 months of warranty left..  Amazon was great.... After going through some trouble shooting.. they sent me a new Firestick 4k max and it works great.. Even has volume controlling with the Bluetooth earbuds..  4 stars to 5 stars .. thank you Amazon..",5
David Ficke,Works well,Works like it is supposed to. No problems with setup or use.,3

Bruce L.,Tested Review Vs Google Chrome-It’s on Fire !! stick to it !!!,"Read through this insight and hope it’s helpful guide.Let me start by saying I have few Smart TVs at home and have been using google chrome cast for over 5 years.I landed on fire stick as I have prime account and wanted to test and see how it functionsKey Observations1. Works seamless with Samsung smart tv and LG smart tv2. Alexa voice  on remote in great vs it’s absent on chrome3. You can control tv volume and external sound bar connected to tv through it- can’t do this on chrome4. Processor is fast and smooth user experience5. Value for money, keep an eye on Amazon website as it’s there home product and they run deep discounts on it many timesFinal Verdict - Really satisfied with fire stick and infact have purchased 2 of these now!!Hope this is helpful !",4

Nick,Cut the cord finally,I wanted to get rid of xfinity. Every other month an increase. So I ordered this for my 4k tv. My family streamed for years so this was so easy. It was faster than the other ones we have. Great picture. Wish I would have done this years ago. I highly recommend this product you won’t be disappointed.,4
terri ward,Works,Amzon fire sticks do what I need them to do at a lower price.,4
Merrill,Second time is a charm,Bought four fire sticks in May 2022. All were working fine .  One fire stick in the family room would go off line without any reason.  Tested one fire stick from another room and it worked thus the reason for this new replacement.  I guess that other fire stick was a lemon.  Hopefully I will not have to replace,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Great for our non-cable TVs,"We don't have cable boxes for all our TVs, but with the Amazon Fire stick we can connect to our cable app and watch cable without the cost of additional boxes.",4

Kevin M Lyon,Making old smart TV’s new again,"My TV wouldn’t update apps anymore, it wasn’t as smart as it used to be. So I bought this so I could stream on my 65” Samsung again. It connects to my internet just fine, not glitching, has lots more apps than we’re available through my TV before, and it updates consistently. Basically it will stay as smart as it is suppose to be until Amazon stops updating, or overwhelms the memory space on it with updates. Lol. Then I’ll be back for the new model, so we can do it all over again. Over all works great just as it’s suppose to be. This is my second purchase.",4
Merrill,WONDERFUL,This is a great remote.  Installation in about 3 minutes or less.  The only improvement needed is it has to be made to open easier to install the batteries.  I had to use a sharp object to open it.  I had the same problem years ago with other fire remotes.,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Great experience with Fire TV Stick 4K,I bought it to watch the lord of the rings TV series. It's resolution was very great even with my old TV. The TV Show was really interesting. kkkkk,4

Ted C,Easy to set up,Quick integration. Fast set up. Great features,4
Dan R.,Replaced an older firetv stick,I was watching LOTR on the old version of the fire tv stick and the audio kept getting out of sync. I’m not having that problem with the 4K version. I probably would have stayed on the older one but I love LOTR and couldn’t stand the sync issues.,4
Steve Horton Sr.,Easy to program and use!,I used it in my RV! It’s made my stay while I travel a thousand times better!

Charles Burks Jr,This review would have been exactly the OPPOSITE but Amazon came through,"I ordered a 2nd Firestick as we switched to YouTubeTV and the reception was horrible in the Man Cave. When I got it I noticed that the envelope it came in was a bit abused as well ass the box the Firestick came in. Well, I hooked it all up and everything WORKED! Then I went to bed and the next day woke up to find out NOTHING was working!!! So, after screwing around for an hour I googled ""Firestick controller not responding"" and followed the instructions from several sites. I finally just reset the stick to ""factory settings"" and it worked again! YAY! Well, the next day I woke up to find it was worse than before and the remote wouldn't do anything. So, I called AMAZON and they sent me out a replacement the SAME DAY!!! This one arrived with no apparent damage so I hooked it up and got it going. Had to get PRIME / YOUTUBE / YOUTUBETV / NETFLIX / HULU all working from the Firestick remote - and I did!  Having all this and voice recognition from ONE controller was amazing - too good to believe. Well, I went to bed in great trepidation but the next day everything was WORKING!!!!  I can't explain the JOY in my heart that happened after being so freaking MAD the prior one was faulty. I'm 70 and the TV is my main source of life enjoyment and now everything was flowing effortlessly. AMAZON really came through and turned my anger into pure JOY with one controller that does everything. So------- I guess I am writing this to say if you get one that doesn't work CALL AMAZON (the phone number is right on the work order) and they will set you right. I always think it's ME when something goes wrong but in this case it WAS the Stick!",5
Kim,Amazing Product,You can't beat the price point for the quality of the product. I have bought 5 of these. Definitely recommend the firestick with volume control.,3

Chuck,Worked Great.... pleased with sound quality,"My hearing aids were affordable and I received a discount. They are easy to use and comfortable, with a variable volume setting. My order came quickly and I have been wearing them for a year and half. Still working great and I would purchase again.",4
Merrill,First time using a fire stick I was happy with the first one and I bought another one,I tend to fall asleep with the TV on and when I wake up it's on the screen telling me are you still there I think that's good to have because it automatically shuts off if you don't respond by a certain period of time,4

Emily Dortch,Excellent,"This is a great device. I didn’t want to spend a lot on a smart tv and the guy in the store recommended the fire stick. I was using my laptop connected to the tv for the various streaming apps and instead I’m now using this fire stick and a very clever remote, half the size of the previous one.

This is a simple solution!It also ADDED many streaming channels, and by adding an antenna, they  allowed me to fully cut the cable cord.  Internet is required for streaming.",3
Gioni,Great Streaming Device!,Love the remote features as long as my kids don’t loose the remote again I am happy!,4

William Porter,Upgrade if you are thinking about it,I had the old old original fire stick. And I had a feeling that I needed to upgrade. My streaming was SUPER slow I had to unplug and plug back in the stick constantly to have quality picture. I thought maybe it was my 5G home internet issue. But something told me I should try upgrading the stick first. Voila problem solved 200%,3

steelerfan,Love this unit,"We had been using an older Roku device that was acting up and was lower resolution.  Got this device on special sale and love it.  Really like the 4k quality, the fact the remote controls the unit, our LG TV and Onkyo surround-sound.  Connecting/sync'ing was a breeze.  Also like all the options under Settings including increasing your privacy if you don't particularly want the world knowing exactly what you watch. Note that we do NOT have Alexa (circle back to us not wanting the world listening/knowing what we watch, now add to that the entire world knowing every word being said whether you want that or not) so can't speak to the interface with that (""Asian country"") made spy device.We most definitely recommend this unit.",4
WILLIAM M.,Great,I just hope it continues working as well as it does...love it,4
Amazon Customer,Works great as everyone already knows BUT DONT PAY FULL PRICE BC IT GOES ON SALE OFTEN,Works great as everyone already knows BUT DONT PAY FULL PRICE BC IT GOES ON SALE OFTEN,4

Merrill,Better picture,Made the switch from Satellite to Hulu.  Thought about getting another TV because we felt the picture wasn’t very good but with the new 4K Firestick picture is much improved.  Very satisfied,4
Mark R. Wietstock,Fire stick worked great to stream. We do not have smart tv’s,Wanted to stream our tv’s and get rid of cable.  Thought we would have to purchase new smart tv’s. The fire stick enabled us to stream without having to buy new tv’s,4

Ley,"Bought on sale, love these",Should have upgraded my old Fire Sticks ages ago. They were so buggy and I constantly had to reset them or at least restart them. I didn't upgrade them cuz I kept thinking maybe I was going to get smart TVs but I never did and these new Fire Sticks are brilliant they work flawlessly and they control the TV power and TV volume on all my TVs and just overall work so much better. Very happy I bought these when they went on sale.,4
A. C.,"great quality, excellent value",I like that the Fire Stick does not need to be stationed like other streaming devices. It can just go hidden behind the tv. It works quickly and the video quality is great. Its also a nice gift for someone that just got their own place and does not cost as much as other streaming devices so no need to break the bank! It’s a very good value.,5

MrBurton,Well Worth Upgrading,"Replaced an old fire stick that died.  The upgraded remote makes it worth the price. It controls my old 2006 Insignia TV and my Samsung soundbar too.

Dawson,Want an easy way to add a TV to your home at a low cost? Firestick.  No cable. No dish. Just WIFI.,"I wanted a TV to watch while we exercised in the basement.  If I added it to my cable setup, I would need another box from the cable company (additional $10/mo.) and probably a house call for service to change- out existing hardware ($100).  I had an extra TV so all I needed was a Firestick and WIFI savvy son-in-law ($50).",5

Cancel the cable and saved me about $100 a month, and that includes adding the service of YouTube, Prime, and my NetFlix subscription. Still savings and the DVR option is awesome.",4

Mark R. Wietstock,"Goodbye Dish, Hello Fire TV Stick 4K","I was paying over $180/month for dishNetwork watching very few of their package useless channels.  My Fire TV sticks are the perfect streaming devices.  They're small and easily hidden behind TV or HTS.  Fire TV Sticks give me everything I like and more.  I only pay for the the streaming services (YouTube TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBOMax, AppleTV, and others) I want and like.  Having a single controller to control Fire TV, Television, AppleTV, and Home Theater System is a big plus.  I will be buying my 3rd and 4th FireTV Sticks soon.",3

jaegeun,Actually Free,"We were totally sick of paying 100 plus dollars a month for cable TV for years. I was very skeptical about these new steaming sticks. We had the FireStick on sale at work for 39 dollars and I had an employee discount so I said what the hell and bought one. I love it! Super easy to install. Plug it in and do what it tells you. Could not be easier and it worked. You download a bunch of Apps and then you have access to a massive amount of free movies and television shows. I was totally surprised. You do have to have an Amazon account which if you order anything from Amazon you should have anyway. I also have really good internet service from Xfinity and haven't seen any problems with shows lagging or buffering. I don't know how a slow internet will work with this. The Alexa button is pretty neat also. She actually listens and makes an attempt to do what you ask. Also all kinds of news channels, even a local news app. The non liberal news channels are available which is a requirement for me. One thing I noticed is whenever you download a free app you get a bill statement for zero dollars from Amazon. I always find statements that look like bills to be frightening. However everything has been totally free and they make it clear if it isn't. In conclusion, I would say there is a definite learning curve but this thing is 100 million times better than cable and 100 million times cheaper. I totally recommend it. The only thing you need to investigate is how good does your internet need to be. Great job by Amazon!",4
